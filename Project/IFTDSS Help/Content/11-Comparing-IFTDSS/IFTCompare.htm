        <p>The IFTDSS software integration framework provides a portal to the scientific algorithms and models that exist in commonly used fire and fuels software applications.  The modules in IFTDSS are organized to fulfill specific business needs, which have been defined as IFTDSS workflows.  In some cases, only specific functional pieces of larger applications have been implemented.  Many modules and software applications have been and will be added to IFTDSS. </p>
        <p>Quality assurance tasks are performed to ensure the modules implemented in IFTDSS provide the same numerical values as the standalone desktop versions of the modules.  Additionally, the functionality of the modules implemented in IFTDSS has been compared with the original standalone desktop applications.  These comparisons were made to inform users about the functionality that is and is not included in the IFTDSS implementation.</p>
        <p>To obtain module-specific quality assurance test information, see <a href="../10-Reference/RefModelTests.htm">Module Test Cases</a>.</p>
        <p>To date, the following comparisons have been conducted:</p>
