        <p>This approach is somewhat more sophisticated than the worst-case flame length approach in that it considers the likelihood of a fire burning as a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire given a random ignition in the landscape when determining the potential losses or benefits for an area represented by a pixel burning.</p>
        <p>This approach is useful when the user is interested in identifying the potential consequences of an area represented by a pixel burning under variable fire conditions and/or assessing the potential ecological benefits of using fire as a management tool.</p>
