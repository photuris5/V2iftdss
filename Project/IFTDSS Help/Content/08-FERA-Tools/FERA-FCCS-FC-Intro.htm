        <p>FCCS summarizes and calculates fuel characteristics by using fuelbed inputs and default variables inferred by species. Many of the fuel characteristics calculated in FCCS are used to calculate FCCS surface fire behavior and fire potentials (table 2)(Riccardi et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Riccardietal2007b">2007b</a>).</p>
        <p>The FCCS summarizes and calculates the following fuel characteristics:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li><b>Percentage cover</b>. Percentage cover is generally a fuelbed input and not actually calculated. It refers to the percentage cover by crown projection of trees, shrubs, and nonwoody fuels, and by linear estimates of woody and ground fuels.</li>
            <li><b>Depth</b>. Depth of each fuel stratum and category is a basic input measure of the vertical structure of a fuelbed. The term height (ft) is used in canopy, shrub, and nonwoody fuels strata; depth (inches) is used for woody fuels, LLM, and ground fuels strata. For consistency, FCCS only considers the depth of downed fine woody fuels less than or equal to three inches in diameter in the woody fuels stratum and does not include stumps or piles in this measure.</li>
            <li><b>Fuel loading (total, live, and dead)</b>. Unless input directly into FCCS, fuel loading is calculated from dimensional inputs and summarized as total, live, and dead loading by stratum, category, and subcategory in reports.</li>
            <li><b>Fuel area index (FAI)</b>. Fuel area index (FAI) is a relatively new and useful concept in fire behavior modeling (Riccardi et al., 2007b). Analogous to leaf area index, FAI is the surface area of fuels per unit ground area. To assimilate the heterogeneous fuel structures captured by FCCS fuelbeds, FCCS calculates the total fuel surface area on all size classes of fuels, including live foliar biomass. FAI is used in the calculation of surface fire behavior and FCCS fire potentials.</li>
            <li><b>Packing ratio</b>. Packing ratio is the fraction of a fuelbed volume that is occupied by fuel particles (Rothermel, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Rothermel1972">1972</a>) and is an important factor in predicting fire behavior.</li>
            <li><b>Density</b>. Density refers to the number of trees, stumps, and other fuel categories per acre. Density values are input into the FCCS and summarized and reported by the calculator.</li>
            <li><b>Height to live crown</b>. Applicable only to the tree category of the canopy stratum, height to live crown, defined as the distance from the ground to bottom of each canopy layer, is input into the FCCS and summarized and reported by the calculator.</li>
            <li><b>Diameter at breast height</b>. Applicable only to the tree and snag categories of the canopy stratum, diameter at breast height is input into the FCCS and summarized and reported by the calculator.</li>
        </ul>
