            <MadCap:keyword term="FCCS fuelbed editor" />Using the Fuelbed Editor</h1>
        <p>You can use the fuelbed editor to create a new fuelbed. Whenever you save modifications to an FCCS fuelbed, FCCS automatically saves it as a custom fuelbed. </p>
        <p><b style="font-style: italic;">To create a new fuelbed,</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a fuelbed from the FCCS fuelbed library, preferably one that has similar inputs to your site.<br /><br />In many cases, you may have only a few measurements or input variables that you want to change out of the hundreds that are available for a fuelbed.   Select the best matched fuelbed and only change those inputs where you have measurements of improved values and retain the rest of the inputs from the original FCCS fuelbed selected.<br /></li>
            <li>Edit data to best match your fuelbed.<br /><br />Enter only those inputs applicable to your fuelbed. For example, if your fuelbed is a grassland with no trees or shrubs, simply click “Not present” in the Canopy and Shrub stratum screens.<br /><br />  You may wish to enter minimum and maximum values to represent the range of fuel conditions for the area or site you are representing.</li>
            <li>Save your fuelbed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once you have saved your fuelbed, you can use FCCS to calculate outputs using that fuelbed. Your new fuelbed will also be accessible when you search for fuelbeds by opening your fuelbed by file name.</p>
        <h2>Common Input Errors</h2>
        <p>With over 300 possible inputs, take care when editing fuelbeds.  Common input errors include</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Adding dimensional or loading data to a fuel category (e.g., sound woody fuel) but forgetting to input species and relative covers.</li>
            <li>Forgetting to input Total Canopy Cover in the Canopy Stratum.</li>
            <li>Forgetting that input species relative covers must sum to 100%.</li>
            <li>Entering percent cover and height in the Nonwoody stratum, but forgetting to enter a loading value.</li>
            <li>Entering loading values for sound and rotten downed woody fuels, but forgetting to enter an overall depth and percent cover in the "All woody" tab.</li>
            <li>Entering litter dimensions, but forgetting to specify a litter arrangement and type.</li>
            <li>Entering duff dimensions, but forgetting to specify a duff derivation.</li>
            <li>Using variable units (English or metric).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Customize Fuelbed Screen</h2>
        <p>You can use the customize fuelbed screen to modify search variables (such as ecoregion division, vegetation form, and cover type) and other descriptive inputs. You may change or add fuel moisture scenarios, midflame wind speed (mph), slope gradient (%), and a site photo on the environmental variables page.</p>
        <h2>Common/Scientific Name Lookup Tool</h2>
        <p>Species names of trees, shrubs, and nonwoody fuels are listed as scientific names in the FCCS editor. To find common name equivalents for a scientific name, or to look up a scientific name by common name, click the <b>Common-Scientific name</b> lookup link at the top of any fuelbed editor screen. Select the <b>Scientific name</b> radio button to search scientific names or the <b>Common name</b> radio button to search common names.</p>
        <p>Scroll down and select a name from the left panel. If you select a scientific name, common name and outmoded scientific name matches are listed in the right panel. If you select a common name, scientific name and outmoded scientific name matches are listed.</p>
