        <h1>Westrn Fuel Consumption</h1>
        <p>Throughout the interior West, ponderosa pine forests and savannas have been altered by decades of fire exclusion (Allen et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Allenetal2002">2002</a>). Accumulation of surface fuels and increased stand densities have led to a variety of forest health problems and potential for high-intensity fire in many forests. Fire is increasingly being used to restore ponderosa pine forests to open stand conditions and to reduce surface fuel accumulations. Bringing fire back to many of these forests comes with risks and potential environmental impacts. Prescribed and wildland use fires are restricted in their application due to smoke emissions, narrow prescription windows, potential for extreme fire behavior, and proximity to homes and communities.</p>
