            <MadCap:keyword term="activity fuels:definition" />Activity Fuels</h1>
        <p>Activity fuels are those fuels resulting from or altered by forestry practices such as timber harvesting or thinning younger than 15 years. Mathematical descriptions of these fuels were developed for use in Consume 1.0 and 2.1.  Natural fuel equations are used to calculate canopy, shrub, herbaceous, stump, basal accumulation, and squirrel midden consumption.  Consumption of natural and machine piles is calculated using the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/nwfire/piles">Pile Calculator</a>.</p>
        <p>Consume uses separate algorithms to predict consumption of 1-hour and 10-hour fuels, 100-hour fuels, large woody fuels, and duff (Ottmar et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Ottmaretal1993">1993</a>). </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Fuel loading, slope, wind speed, and 10-hour fuel moisture are used to predict the consumption of the 1-hour, 10-hour, and 100-hour fuels.</li>
            <li>The most important factor in determining total large woody fuel consumption is the 1000-hour fuel moisture content (1000-Th).  You can either enter a measured value directly or use the NFDRS-1000-hour (NFDRS-Th ) value (Deeming et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Deemingetall1977">1977</a>). Direct measurement of the 1000-hour fuel moisture content is the best predictor of fuel consumption.</li>
            <li>Major variables that control duff consumption include woody fuel consumption, diameter reduction, preburn duff depth, and duff moisture content.  The duff consumption algorithm is divided into separate regimes for wet, moist, and dry duff. Because actual duff moisture content is difficult to measure, Consume classifies duff as wet, moist, or dry based on days since significant rainfall. </li>
