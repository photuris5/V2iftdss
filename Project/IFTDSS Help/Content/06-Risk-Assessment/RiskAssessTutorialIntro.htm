        <p>IFTDSS provides two approaches for assessing fire hazard and risk across the landscape. To illustrate how to use the risk assessment workflow  in IFTDSS, we have prepared some tutorials that walk through some common activities.</p>
        <p>The <a href="RiskAssessWorstCaseTutorial.htm">first tutorial</a> explains how to use IFTDSS to create a risk assessment using the worst-case flame lengths approach.  This approach is referred to as the “worst case” estimation of fire risk  because it is based on a single FlamMap  run, where the areas represented by every pixel are all always assumed to burn under the worst case (i.e., by a head fire).</p>
        <p>The <a href="RiskAssessFlameLengthTutorial.htm">second tutorial</a> explains how to use IFTDSS to create a risk assessment using the flame length probabilities approach.  This approach differs from the worst-case flame length approach in that it considers the likelihood of a fire burning as a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire given a random ignition in the landscape when determining the potential losses or benefits of an area represented by a pixel burning.</p>
        <p>Both of the tutorials create a risk assessment using the same project area (Olompali State Historic Park, just north of Novato, California).  To compare the differences between the two approaches for assessing risk assessment in IFTDSS, please review both risk assessment tutorials.</p>
