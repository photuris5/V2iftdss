        <p>On the <strong>Relative Net Value Change</strong> step, you can view your area of interest by flame length class (binned by the flame length classes you defined on <MadCap:xref href="RiskAssessWC-25-FLclasses.htm"><strong>Step 11: Set Flame Length Classes</strong></MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <p>In this example, very high flame lengths (&gt;11 ft) are predicted for the northeast corner (outlined in blue:  Burdell Open Space Preserve, Pierre Joske Grove, and private oak woodlands).</p>

        <p>Taking a first look at the default relative net value change parameter, we can see that there are many pixels classified in the <strong>Greatest Loss/Least Benefit</strong> category (pixels representing areas at the highest risk of loss based on the values at risk and the overall burn probability).</p>
        <p>In this example, we cannot apply fuel treatments to all of the areas represented by the <strong>Greatest Loss/Least Benefit</strong> pixels, so we would like to refine the area of interest to find the areas that have the greatest potential loss.</p>
