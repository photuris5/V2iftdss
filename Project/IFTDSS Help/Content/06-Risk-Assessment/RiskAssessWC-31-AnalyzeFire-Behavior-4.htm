        <p>Taking a simple first look at the flame length output, it is clear that the red flag warning environmental conditions (the IFT-FlamMap inputs provided as described in <MadCap:xref href="RiskAssessWC-23-IFT-FlamMap.htm"><b>Step 9: Enter Values for IFT-FlamMap</b></MadCap:xref>) predicted high flame lengths for a majority of the area of interest.</p>
        <p>To determine potential flame length variability across the landscape, use the <b>Values at Risk</b> overlay and the <b>Point Info</b> tool.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>In this example, the lowest predicted flame lengths are located in a portion of private land (oak woodlands) and the north end of the Burdell Open Space Preserve (outlined in yellow in the image).</li>
            <li>Flame lengths for the surrounding areas are predicted to be &gt;9 ft.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>After reviewing the fire behavior data, the next step is to run the risk model.   To run the model, choose <b>Next</b> at the bottom of the page.</p>
        <p>After you run the model, in the next step in the pathway (Relative Net Change), you will see that the flame length layer has been binned by your pre-set flame length classes (as set in <MadCap:xref href="RiskAssessWC-25-FLclasses.htm"><b>Step 11: Set Flame Length Classes</b></MadCap:xref>).</p>
