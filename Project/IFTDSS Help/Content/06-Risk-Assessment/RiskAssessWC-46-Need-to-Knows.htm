            <li>Fire behavior <MadCap:keyword term="worst-case flame length risk assessments:fire behavior and" />values are calculated pixel-by-pixel and are <strong>simulated independently</strong> with respect to the surrounding pixels in the landscape input file.</li>
            <li>For the <a href="../10-Reference/RefFlamMap.htm">IFT-FlamMap</a> output, fire behavior in adjacent locations, roads, or hazardous fuel types in proximity to the area under assessment does not affect the fire behavior potential of the pixel (or point location) being assessed.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="LANDFIRE:data resolution" />The LANDFIRE data resolution is 30 x 30 m spatial resolution, which affects data interpretation.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="worst-case flame length risk assessments:random ignitions:assumptions about" />The worst-case flame lengths approach assumes random ignitions across the area of interest; however, some areas have higher ignition potentials than others. For example, human-caused ignitions often occur close to roads and natural ignitions caused by lightning occur at elevated areas. This approach does not yet take this into account. </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="worst-case flame length risk assessments:values at risk damage and" />The worst-case flame lengths risk assessment approach may overestimate the degree of damage to the value at risk in an area represented by an individual pixel.</li>
