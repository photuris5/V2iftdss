        <p>This area is at risk for high potential loss from fire. Under the red flag warning conditions, which predicted high to very high flame lengths, the likelihood this area will ignite is moderate.</p>
        <p>It is also important to review the landscape data in your area of interest. In this example, which uses the IFT-FlamMap surface fire behavior input layers, this location is dominated by flashy fuels:  <strong>Fuel Model 1: Short Grass</strong> (indicated in yellow) and <strong>Fuel Model 2: Timber Grass and Understory</strong> (light blue).</p>

        <p> The wildland-urban interface has moderate, south- to southwest-facing slopes.</p>

        <p>After reviewing the modeled fire behavior, fire risk, and spatial landscape data, the areas outlined <MadCap:xref href="RiskAssessFLP-42-Google-Earth-3.htm"><b>Step 9b: Identify Potential Fire Hazards and Risk</b></MadCap:xref> may warrant further analyses and may require site visits and/or fuels treatments.</p>
        <p>Continue to analyze high risk areas using the information in <MadCap:xref href="RiskAssessFLP-42-Google-Earth-3.htm"><b>Step 9b: Identify Potential Fire Hazards and Risk</b></MadCap:xref>  and <MadCap:xref href="RiskAssessFLP-43-Google-Earth-4.htm"><b>Step 9c: Focus on Highest Risk Areas</b></MadCap:xref>.</p>
