        <p>We have found that this area is at risk for high potential loss from fire. Under the red flag warning conditions (that we set in <MadCap:xref href="RiskAssessWC-23-IFT-FlamMap.htm"><b>Step 9: Enter Values for IFT-FlamMap</b></MadCap:xref>), which predicted high to very high flame lengths, the likelihood this area will ignite is moderate.</p>
        <p>It is also important to review the landscape data in your area of interest. (This example uses the IFT-FlamMap surface fire behavior input layers.)&#160;This location is dominated by flashy fuels:  <strong>Fuel Model 1: Short Grass</strong> (indicated in yellow) and <strong>Fuel Model 2: Timber Grass and Understory</strong> (light blue).</p>

        <p> The wildland-urban interface has moderate, south- to southwest-facing slopes.</p>

        <p>After reviewing the modeled fire behavior, fire risk, and spatial landscape data, the areas outlined in <MadCap:xref href="RiskAssessWC-41-GoogleEarth-Hazards.htm"><b>Step 20a: Identify Potential Fire Hazards and Risk</b></MadCap:xref> may warrant further analyses and may require site visits and/or fuels treatments.</p>
        <p>Continue to analyze high risk areas using the information in <MadCap:xref href="RiskAssessWC-41-GoogleEarth-Hazards.htm"><b>Step 20a: Identify Potential Fire Hazards and Risk</b></MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="RiskAssessWC-42-GoogleEarth-Hazards2.htm"><b>Step 20b: Focus on Highest Risk Areas</b></MadCap:xref>.</p>
