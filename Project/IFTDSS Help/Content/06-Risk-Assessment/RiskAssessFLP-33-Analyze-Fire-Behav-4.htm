        <p>Taking a first look at the outputs for <strong>Burn Probability at Low Flame Lengths</strong> (0 to 4 ft) and <strong>Burn Probability at High Flame Lengths</strong> (8 to 11 ft), it is clear that the red flag warning environmental conditions (which we specified in <MadCap:xref href="RiskAssessFLP-25-Input-Params-2.htm"><strong>Step 4a: Input Fuel and Moisture Values</strong></MadCap:xref>) predicted that if the area represented by a pixel were to burn under these conditions, that area is more likely to burn with low flame lengths than high flame lengths.</p>
        <p>Use the <strong>Values at Risk</strong> overlay and the <strong>Point Info</strong> tool to determine potential burn probability variability across the landscape. After reviewing the burn probability data, choose <strong>Next</strong> at the bottom of the page (not shown here) to run the risk model.</p>
