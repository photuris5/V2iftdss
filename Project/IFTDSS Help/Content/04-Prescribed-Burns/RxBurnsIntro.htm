        <p>All prescribed fires require an approved plan, called a prescribed burn plan, that must be followed when a burn is conducted.  The prescribed fire burn plan is the legal document that provides an agency administrator with the information needed to approve a prescribed fire.</p>
        <h2>IFTDSS&#160;and Prescribed Burn Planning</h2>

        <p>The tools provided under the IFTDSS prescribed burn planning directory aid fuels treatment planners and prescribed fire planners in assessing fire behavior and effects for varying fuel and environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>In addition, IFTDSS contains tools for preparing and downloading a burn plan document that is based on the guidelines in <i>The Interagency Prescribed Fire Planning and Implementation Procedures Guide</i> (U. S. Department of Agriculture and U. S. Department of the Interior, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#USDA2008Rx">2008</a>).</p>
        <p>Using the tools in IFTDSS, you can</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Model fire behavior and fire effects for different fuel models and environmental scenarios.</li>
            <li>Create a prescribed burn plan. As part of your planning process, you can save a Word file from IFTDSS that has a number of elements filled in from your module runs. </li>
            <div>
                <form>
                    <fieldset class="note">
                        <legend>&#160;&#160;&#160;Important&#160;&#160;&#160;</legend>
                        <p class="noteBody">Microsoft Word 2007 or later, or Word 2003 with the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack, is required to open the burn plan document. You can <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=3">download the compatibility pack</a> at Microsoft.com.</p>
                    </fieldset>

        <h2>Top-Level Tasks</h2>
        <p>To access and run the fire behavior and fire effects modules within IFTDSS, or to run one or more modules,</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine your analysis goals and the type(s) of fire behavior and/or fire effects output information you wish to analyze.</li>
            <li><a href="../03-Concepts/ProjCreate.htm">Create a new project.</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="../03-Concepts/ProjRun.htm">Create a new run.</a>
            </li>
            <li>Select the <b>Prescribed Burn Planning</b> workflow.</li>
            <li>Select the module(s) you wish to run. Depending on your needs, there are a number of different modules in IFTDSS that can be used to create a prescribed burn plan. The matrix on the <a href="RxBurnsObj.htm">Overview and Objectives</a> page shows which modules are useful for which elements in the prescribed burn plan. The table on the <a href="../03-Concepts/ModelsRx.htm">Modules for Prescribed Burn Planning</a> page provides an overview of the fire modules that are useful for prescribed burn planning.</li>
            <li>Configure the module and input the needed data. The inputs and outputs for the modules in the prescribed burn planning work flow are listed in the <a href="../10-Reference/RefIntro.htm">Reference</a> section.</li>
            <li>View and interpret your results.</li>
            <li>Export your results from IFTDSS to your local computer.</li>
            <li>Edit your burn plan document, then print it as you would any Word document.</li>
        </ol>
