        <h1>Fire Behavior Analysis and Outputs</h1>
        <p>In IFTDSS, a prescribed burn planner can run multiple fire behavior scenarios over a range of environmental conditions.  In this workflow, SURFACE/SIZE (as implemented in BehavePlus), FCCS Surface Fire Behavior, and FlamMap are available for modeling fire behavior for a single point location.  SURFACE/SIZE is available as implemented in BehavePlus and requires manual input data for a single point location.  The FCCS Surface Fire Behavior model uses FCCS Fuelbed data as input and models fire behavior for a specific fuelbed.  FlamMap in its native state produces spatial data by calculating fire behavior simulations across a set of pixels and produces digital maps of fire behavior parameters. </p>
        <p>In the prescribed burn work flow, FlamMap is operating as a single point fire behavior emulator (such as BehavePlus and NEXUS).  Using FlamMap as a single point fire behavior emulator is scientifically valid for simulating surface fire behavior because BehavePlus, NEXUS, and FlamMap use the same base algorithms for their fire behavior calculations (Andrews, 2007).  Differences arise between FlamMap and BehavePlus when canopy fire is considered due to subtle differences between the models in the mechanisms used to lift fire into the canopy (Scott and Reinhardt, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#ScottandReinhardt2001">2001</a>; Scott, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Scott2006">2006</a>). A comparison analysis among BehavePlus, NEXUS, and FlamMap was performed as a validation exercise.  The results of the comparison can be viewed here .</p>
        <h2>IFTDSS Fire Behavior Simulation Functionality</h2>
        <p> In IFTDSS, you can investigate how varying environmental influences on fire behavior simulations influence fire activity in real world situations.  For example, the influence of changing fuels under constant weather conditions can be compared if multiple fuel types exist within a single burn unit.  Or the prescribed burn planner may be interested in determining under what fuel moisture ranges the fire containment team can maintain the fire within the unit boundaries while simultaneously meeting the burn objectives.</p>
