        <p>The hazard analysis workflow provides tools for performing a current-condition assessment of fire hazard within an area of interest. The focus of this workflow is to identify areas that warrant further analysis because of the potential fire hazard in those areas. High fire hazard is expressed by high potential fire behavior (e.g., flame length, rate of spread, and fireline intensity) and/or undesirable fire effects (e.g., tree mortality and emissions).</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="prescribed burn plans:hazard analysis and;hazard analysis:prescribed burn planning and" />Fire hazard analysis can be viewed as an initial step in the fuels treatment and/or prescribed burn planning process(es), and can be performed across many geographic scales (e.g., national, district, watershed). </p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="fire hazards:definition of term" />The term "fire hazard" is defined as an act or phenomenon with the potential to do harm (NRC, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#NRC1989">1989</a>; Keane et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Keaneetal2010">2010</a>).  Fire hazard in this context is expressed as potential fire behavior (such as flame length) which is related to fuel properties within the area of interest (Keane et al., 2010).  Fire hazard is often expressed independently of weather (Hardy, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Hardy2005">2005</a>), yet the potential effects of fire on values at risk are influenced by weather and its relationship to fuel moisture.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="hazard analysis:fire behavior across a landscape (as implemented in FlamMap);fire behavior:analyzing:hazard analysis and" />In IFTDSS, there are two modules you can use in the hazard analysis workflow.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can input constant weather and fuel moisture conditions using a fire behavior mapping and analysis software application called fire behavior across a landscape (<a href="../10-Reference/RefFlamMap.htm">IFT-FlamMap</a>).  The module uses environmental variables, along with spatial landscape data, to compute potential fire behavior characteristics (such as rate of spread, flame length, and fireline intensity) for an entire landscape.</li>
            <li>You can use the burn probability module (<a href="../10-Reference/RefRAN.htm">IFT-FlamMap-RANDIG</a>) to simulate burn probability across an entire landscape.  The burn probability module creates raster maps of composite burn probabilities (burn probabilities for all flame lengths) and raster maps of burn probabilities for a set of user-defined flame length classes.  This module can be used for hazard analysis and is an essential component of the <a href="../06-Risk-Assessment/RiskAssessIntro.htm">risk assessment workflow</a>.</li>
