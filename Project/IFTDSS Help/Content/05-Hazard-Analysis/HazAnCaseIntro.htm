        <p>To illustrate how to use the hazard analysis workflow in IFTDSS, we have prepared some tutorials that walk through some common activities.</p>
        <p><a href="HazAnCase2.htm">The first tutorial</a> explains how to use IFTDSS to perform a landscape-scale hazard analysis to identify areas across a landscape that may be potentially hazardous if a fire were to occur.  This tutorial shows how to</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Acquire LANDFIRE data and set up a project in IFTDSS</li>
            <li>Create a run to model fire behavior across a landscape (IFT-FlamMap)</li>
            <li>Examine data relative to points of interest and other geographic features using Google Earth</li>
            <li>Identify areas of potential fire hazard across a landscape</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="../04-Prescribed-Burns/RxBurnsCase1.htm">The second tutorial</a>, which you will find under Prescribed Burn Planning, explains how to use the hazard analysis tools in IFTDSS for fire contingency planning to support prescribed burn planning.</p>
