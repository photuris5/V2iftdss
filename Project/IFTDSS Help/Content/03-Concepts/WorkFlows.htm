            <MadCap:keyword term="work flows:overview" />Overview of Workflows</h1>
        <p>Leading up to the development of IFTDSS, efforts were made to understand the decision support needs and workflow processes involved in fuels treatment planning and management.&#160;&#160;As a result of these efforts, the following six workflows have been identified:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="li_1">The <b><MadCap:keyword term="data acquisition and preparation:uses for" />data acquisition and preparation</b> workflow provides tools for acquiring and preparing the vegetation data needed for input to fire behavior and fire effects modules. IFTDSS supports the use of <a href="../10-Reference/RefLANDFIRE.htm">LANDFIRE</a> and <a href="../10-Reference/RefFCCSData.htm">FCCS Fuelbed</a> data.</li>
            <li class="li_1">The <MadCap:keyword term="prescribed burn plans:uses for" /><b><a href="../04-Prescribed-Burns/RxBurnsIntro.htm">prescribed burn planning</a></b> workflow provides the information needed to plan and document a proposed prescribed fire. IFTDSS provides tools that support this workflow; with these tools, you can</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>calculate the probability of ignition from lightning or a firebrand</li>
                <li>assess and calculate fire behavior</li>
                <li>assess and plan fire containment</li>
                <li>calculate fire effects</li>
                <li>create a prescribed burn plan (including printing out a Word document with many elements filled in by IFTDSS)</li>
            </ul>
            <li class="li_1">The <b><MadCap:keyword term="hazard analysis:uses for" /><a href="../05-Hazard-Analysis/HazAnIntro.htm">hazard analysis</a></b> workflow is used to identify potentially hazardous areas across a landscape.&#160;The focus of this workflow is to identify areas across a landscape where fuels treatment analysis may be warranted based on potential fire hazard. IFTDSS provides tools that support this workflow.</li>
            <li class="li_1">The <b><MadCap:keyword term="spatially explicit fuels treatment assignments:uses for" />spatially explicit fuels treatment assignment</b> workflow (1) simulates fuels treatment placement in areas of high fire hazard within an area of interest, and (2) simulates post-treatment influences on fire behavior and fire effects potentials.&#160;The spatially explicit fuels treatment assignment workflow extends the hazard analysis to include applying treatments on the landscape and assessing the treatment outcomes.</li>
            <li class="li_1">The <b><MadCap:keyword term="fuels treatment:uses for" />fuels treatment effectiveness over time</b> workflow is used to evaluate the temporal durability of fuels treatments, that is, how long, in years to decades, a treatment will continue to reduce adverse fire behavior and fire effects within an area of interest.&#160; This workflow scenario follows the hazard analysis and fuels treatment assignment workflows.</li>
            <li class="li_1">The <b><MadCap:keyword term="risk assessments:uses for;risk assessments:David Calkin and" /><a href="../06-Risk-Assessment/RiskAssessIntro.htm">risk assessment</a></b> workflow provides a first-approximation probabilistic risk assessment for fuels treatment planning based on the methodology developed by Calkin et al. (<a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Calkinetal2010a">2010a</a>).</li>
        </ul>
