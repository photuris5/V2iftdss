        <p>In IFTDSS, a project is like a workspace. Within a project, you select a data set and establish runs. Projects help you organize your runs and can be themselves organized by workflow.</p>
        <h2>Runs</h2>
        <p>A run defines the activity that you would like to perform and the modules or processes that you will use as part of a run.</p>
        <p>Using a directory structure metaphor, you can view a project as your root directory, with runs as sub-directories.&#160; You can have a single run or multiple runs associated with a project.</p>
        <p>Here is a visual representation of the organization of projects and runs within IFTDSS.</p>

        <p>At a high level, the activities you will be performing are to</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="ProjCreate.htm">Create a new project.</a>
            </li>
            <li>Within a new project, <a href="ProjRun.htm">create a run</a> by first <a href="ProjRun.htm#Choosing">choosing the type of run</a> you wish to make.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>Using the tools available for <a href="../04-Prescribed-Burns/RxBurnsIntro.htm">prescribed burn plannin</a>g, you can model fire behavior and fire effects and perform other types of analyses (i.e., fire containment and probability of ignition) that support the development of burn plan documentation.</li>
                <li>Using the tools available for performing a <a href="../05-Hazard-Analysis/HazAnIntro.htm">hazard analysis</a>, you can model fire behavior across a landscape and identify areas that may be potentially hazardous if a fire were to occur.</li>
                <li>Using the tools available for <a href="../06-Risk-Assessment/RiskAssessIntro.htm">risk assessment</a>, you can examine values at risk, develop values-at-risk maps, and model fire behavior and the expected loss or benefit from fires.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><a href="ProjRun.htm#SelectModel">Select the module</a> you wish to run.</li>
            <li><a href="ProjRun.htm#NameRun">Name your run</a>.</li>
            <li><a href="ProjRun.htm#ConfigureModel">Configure the module</a>.</li>
