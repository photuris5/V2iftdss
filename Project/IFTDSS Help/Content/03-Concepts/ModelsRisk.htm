            <MadCap:keyword term="risk assessments:IFT-FlamMap-RANDIG and;risk assessments:IFT-FlamMap and;burn probability from random ignition (IFT-FlamMap-RANDIG):risk assessments and" />Modules for Risk Assessment</h1>
        <p>The modules used in risk assessment are <a href="../10-Reference/RefFlamMap.htm">IFT-FlamMap</a> and <a href="../10-Reference/RefRAN.htm">IFT-FlamMap-RANDIG</a>.</p>
        <p>IFTDSS  provides two approaches for assessing fire hazard and risk across the landscape based on the methods described in the RMRS-GTR-235 <i>Wildfire Risk and Hazard: Procedures for the First Approximation</i> (Calkin et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Calkinetal2010a">2010a</a>).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Risk Assessment by Worst-Case Flame Lengths<br /><br />This method uses the response functions developed by Calkin et. al. (2010a), modeled flame lengths from the FlamMap fire behavior module, and burn probabilities from the RANDIG burn probability simulator to estimate the likelihood of the area represented by the pixel burning, and the potential consequences if the area represented by the pixel is burned by a head fire.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>Risk Assessment by Flame Length Probabilities<br /><br />This method uses the response functions developed by Calkin et. al. (2010a) and modeled flame length burn probabilities from the RANDIG burn probability simulator to estimate the likelihood of the area represented by the pixel burning, and the potential consequences if the area represented by the pixel is burned by a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The processes proposed by Calkin et al. (2010a) and modified for use in IFTDSS are designed to develop a strategic-level, first approximation of how fire likelihood and fire behavior potentials across landscapes influence risk to social, economic, and ecological values within an area of interest .</p>
