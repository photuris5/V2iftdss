        <h2>Core Organization</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="IFTDSS:organization;organization of IFTDSS" />IFTDSS is organized around projects, data, runs, and modules.</p>
        <p>The modules are organized around <a href="WorkFlows.htm">workflows</a> that address the business needs for fuels treatment planning and management.  The full suite of workflows includes <a href="../04-Prescribed-Burns/RxBurnsIntro.htm">prescribed burn planning</a>, <a href="../05-Hazard-Analysis/HazAnIntro.htm">hazard analysis</a>, spatially explicit fuels treatment assignment, fuels treatment effectiveness, fuels treatment effectiveness over time, and <a href="../06-Risk-Assessment/RiskAssessIntro.htm">risk assessment</a>.  IFTDSS provides tools to support prescribed burn planning, hazard analysis, and risk assessment. </p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="projects:overview;runs:overview" />Projects and Runs</h2>
        <p>Within these workflows, a project is like a workspace.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>When you set up a project, you can select a data set to associate with your project.</li>
            <li>If you are performing a spatial analysis, you define an area of interest  for your project.</li>
            <li>A project can have one or more runs associated with it.  A run defines the activity that you would like to perform and the module(s) or processes that you will use as part of a run.</li>
        </ul>
