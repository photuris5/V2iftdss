        <p><b>Welcome to IFTDSS Version 2.0</b>
        </p>
        <p>As of October 2012, IFTDSS version 2.0 beta is available for testing and evaluation by members of the various cooperating stakeholder groups. Extensive guidance from a broad range of fuels treatment specialists over the last three years has resulted in the identification of five critically important workflow processes:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Prescribed burn planning</li>
            <li>Hazard analysis for current vegetation conditions</li>
            <li>Risk assessment</li>
            <li>Fuels treatment placement and effects analysis for current vegetation conditions</li>
            <li>Assessing fuels treatment effectiveness over time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>IFTDSS 2.0 beta contains each workflow that will be present in the final release. However, ongoing development to improve usability and performance may result in changes to those workflows. You are invited to become an IFTDSS user for testing and evaluation. Please request an account and test drive the system!</p>
        <p>If you have any issues using the system, or if you have suggestions for improvements, please submit your feedback to the IFTDSS development team using the IFTDSS feedback link in the upper right corner of any screen.</p>
