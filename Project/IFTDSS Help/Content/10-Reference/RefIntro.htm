            <li>a section on the 53 <a href="RefFuelModelsOverview.htm">fire behavior fuel models</a> supported by IFTDSS, including <a href="RefFuelModels.htm">a summary table of the individual fire behavior fuel models</a>, with a photo of a typical environment for each model, plus <a href="RefFuelModelsMoisture.htm">a matrix</a> showing which moisture inputs for these fire behavior fuel models are required for each fire model in IFTDSS</li>
            <li>a section on <a href="RefDataIntro.htm">vegetation data sets</a>, where you will find information on the supported vegetation data sets</li>
            <li>an extensive section on <a href="RefModelsIntro.htm">fire models and modules</a>.  IFTDSS is a model integration framework containing a library of available software models and modules.
