        <p>IFTDSS is a model integration framework containing a library of available software models.</p>
        <p>This section contains pages for each fire model supported by IFTDSS. For each model, there are pages containing a brief overview, a link to a PDF containing information specific to each model, and pages providing information about the input and output options and parameters.</p>
        <p>As needed, we have provided citations for works from which models have been derived, with links to the <a href="Bibliography.htm">Bibliography</a>, which contains the full text for each citation and, wherever possible, links to the referenced documents online.</p>
        <h2>Related Topics</h2>
        <p>For additional information, see the <a href="../03-Concepts/Models.htm">overview of all the models in IFTDSS and their capabilities</a>, which includes a description of the IFTDSS workflows and model types.</p>
