        <p>Fuels Characteristics and Classification System (FCCS) fuelbeds represent a set of measured or averaged physical fuel characteristics that characterize a distinct fire environment.  Fuelbeds can represent any scale of interest. </p>
        <p>In the FCCS, fuelbeds represent realistic fuel conditions and can accommodate a wide range of fuel characteristics in six horizontal fuel layers called strata: trees, shrubs, grasses, woody fuels, litter, and duff.</p>
        <p> The fuelbeds were developed by the Fire and Environmental Research Applications Team (FERA) and were compiled from published and unpublished literature, regional workshops, fuels photo series, fuels data sets, and expert knowledge.  Users can access fuelbed data from the national fuelbed database within the FCCS, from FERA's <a href="../08-FERA-Tools/FERA-Consume.htm">Consume 3.0</a>, and from IFTDSS. (For information on the IFTDSS fire behavior module that is related to FCCS fuelbeds, see <a href="RefFCCS.htm">Surface Fire Behavior for FCCS Fuelbeds</a>.)</p>
        <p>The FCCS national fuelbed database contains over 200 standard fuelbeds representing fuel characteristics throughout much of North America.</p>
        <p> Each of these 200 fuelbeds is meant to be a starting point, or baseline, for determining fuel characteristics and fuel loadings across an area of interest.  Source references for each fuelbed are available on the FCCS website at:  <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/fccs/fuelbed_references.shtml">http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/fccs/fuelbed_references.shtml</a>.</p>
