        <p>You can estimate the maximum distance from different possible sources where one can expect potential spot fires, then use that information when preparing a prescribed burn plan. The spotting distance models in IFTDSS produce the same results (which may differ slightly due to rounding) as the spotting distance module in BehavePlus.</p>
        <p>Outputs include spotting distances from burning piles, torching trees, and wind-driven surface fires. For fire potential from each type of spotting distance, there is a set of input and output parameters.</p>

        <p>Spotting distance from a burning pile is the maximum distance at which one can expect potential spot fires resulting from firebrands from a burning pile.</p>
        <p>Input variables include terrain, wind speed, and flame height properties. The model provides spotting distance from a burning pile.</p>

        <p>Spotting distance from torching trees is the maximum distance at which one can expect potential spot fires resulting from firebrands from torching trees.</p>
        <p>Input variables include terrain, wind speed, flame height, and tree characteristics. The model provides spotting distance from torching trees.</p>

        <p>Spotting distance from a wind-driven surface fire is the maximum distance at which one can expect potential spot fires resulting from firebrands from a spreading wind-driven surface fire. </p>
        <p>Input variables include terrain, wind speed, and flame height.  The model provides spotting distance from a wind-driven surface fire.</p>
