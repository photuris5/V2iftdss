        <p>In the flame length probabilities approach to risk assessment, risk is defined as the expected net value change within an area calculated as the product of (1) the probabilities that the area represented by the pixel will burn for user-defined flame length classes (low, medium, high, very high) given a random ignition within the project area, and (2) the resulting change in financial or ecological value (response function) if the area represented by the pixel burns for each user-defined flame length class.</p>
        <p>This method uses the response functions developed by Calkin et. al. (<a href="Bibliography.htm#Calkinetal2010a">2010a</a>) and modeled flame length burn probabilities from the <a href="RefRAN.htm">IFT-FlamMap-RANDIG burn probability simulator</a> to estimate the likelihood of the area represented by the pixel burning, and the potential consequences if the area represented by the pixel is burned by a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire.</p>
        <p>This approach differs from the worst-case flame length approach in that it considers the likelihood of a fire burning as a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire given a random ignition in the landscape when determining the potential losses or benefits of an area represented by a pixel burning.</p>
        <p>This approach is somewhat more sophisticated and is useful when the user is interested in identifying the potential consequences of an area represented by a pixel burning under variable fire conditions and/or assessing the potential ecological benefits of using fire as a management tool.</p>
