            <MadCap:keyword term="edit, map" />Edit Map Legends</h1>
        <p>Users are able to change colors of individual pixels or range of inputs and outputs (ramps), display colors and transparency allowing the user to create custom views that are more intuitive to the user’s particular interest or to emphasize a particular value or range of values.</p>
        <h2 class="noLine" style="text-align: left;">Changing Individual Pixel Color</h2>
        <p>Each individual map legend whether it be fuel models or model output has an “edit” function to the right of the legend title clicking on the “edit” text will open the edit feature window.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>From the edit feature window you are able to click on the legend color boxes for each feature which will open a color pallet from there you may chose a different color to represent that feature on the map. Transparency can also be adjusted at the bottom of the edit feature window to allow better viewing of base map features through the colored overlaying features. When the edits are completed clicking the <b>Apply</b> button will make the changes to the map pixels and legend. If the edits are not satisfactory you may return to the edit feature window and a “revert to system default” text will now appear to the right of the Apply and Cancel buttons allowing the default settings to be restored. <span style="color: #2a3257;"><b>Note</b>: This reverts everything back to the defaults.</span></p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="noLine" style="text-align: left;">Edit Range Values</h2>
        <p>Users may lump, split or customize default values to create output legends to suite their individual needs. For example the user may want to lump the Flame Length values to correspond to the hauling chart and thresholds for direct attack with crews and equipment.</p>
        <p>In the edit feature window change the range values as desired to create custom ranges, such as 0.01 to 4.00 flame lengths. Click the negative sign “–“ to the right of each row to remove unwanted rows. Users may also change colors as desired.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The resulting edit feature window may look something like this below. Note: the Range value for the &gt; 11 ft flame length is set to “Maximum” allowing that range to depict all flame lengths greater than 11 feet. The “Minimum” range feature can be use at the lower end of the scale as well to represent all values below a certain level.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Clicking the <b>Apply</b> button will make the changes to the map pixels and legend. If the changes are not satisfactory returning to the edit feature window you will find a <b>revert to system default</b> text at the bottom of the window, clicking that will restore the default value ranges for all inputs.</p>
