        <p>Users are able to add annotations to maps. This allows the user to label features or add notes to a map.</p>
        <h2 class="noLine" style="text-align: left;">Adding Annotation</h2>
        <p>The <b>Annotation Tool</b> is located in the upper tool bar it looks like a little label with “abc” on it.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Clicking on the tool opens the annotation window from here the user is able to add text, select font color, size, bold, and font style. Then by clicking on the map where you want the text to appear, a “save” button appears in the annotation window. The user may also click on the map where the label is desired before adding and text. The user may also copy and paste text into the annotation label box. This allows special characters to be brought into the map from word processing programs. Images may not be imported in this way only text.</p>
        <p>If the user wishes to remove or edit an annotation this can be done by opening the annotation window and click on the map on the first letter of the label text to be edited or deleted. The label features will now appear in the annotation box and a “delete” button will also appear. The user may edit the label and click <b>save</b> or by clicking the <b>delete</b> button the label will be removed.</p>

        <p>The number of characters that can be added to the label box and have it displayed on the map is dependent on font size and map area available.</p>
