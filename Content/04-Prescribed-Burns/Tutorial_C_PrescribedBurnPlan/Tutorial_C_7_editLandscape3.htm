        <h2>Editing Landscape Data (part 3)</h2>
        <p>After reviewing the data, you can see that several of the grid cells are labeled as FM8:  Compact Timber Litter.  These cells should be changed to <b>FM3:  Tall Grass</b>.</p>
        <p>On the upper toolbar, click the <b>Point Edit tool</b><![CDATA[             ]]><img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_C_PrescribedBurnPlan/tutorial_c_point_edit_tool.png" />and select the desired grid cell.</p>
        <p>The <b>Point Edit</b> panel appears.  From here, you can edit all input values.  In this example, <b>FM3: Tall Grass</b> is selected from the <b>Fuel Model</b> dropdown list.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Some grid cells are labeled as <b>FM8: Compact Timber Litter</b> and <b>FM4: Chaparral</b>, which should be labeled as <b>FM2: Timber Grass</b> and <b>Understory or FM9: Hardwood Litter</b>.  There is also a handful of cells with no data.  These cells are edited one at a time.</p>
        <p>You can also edit the following landscape layers:  canopy base height, canopy height, canopy bulk density, canopy coverage, elevation, aspect, and slope.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>In the example, we showed how grid cells can be edited one by one. There is also an Advanced Editing tool <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_C_PrescribedBurnPlan/tutorial_c_editlandscape4.png" style="width: 44px;height: 40px;" /> that you can use to  edit in query format so you can change multiple cells at once.</p>

                    <p class="noteBody">When you are done editing, choose <b>Save</b> and close the Data Studio window. <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_C_PrescribedBurnPlan/tutorial_c_editlandscape5.png" style="width: 45px;height: 37px;" /> This tutorial illustrates how to edit the fuel model layer. You will also need to edit the canopy fuel layers: canopy height, canopy cover, crown base height, and crown bulk density.</p>
