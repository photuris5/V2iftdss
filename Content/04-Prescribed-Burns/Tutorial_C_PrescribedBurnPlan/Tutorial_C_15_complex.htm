        <h2>Complexity Analysis Summary (Element 3 and Appendix C)</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the complexity rating process is to provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>assignment of a complexity rating of high, moderate, or low to the prescribed fire</li>
            <li>a relative ranking as to the overall complexity of a specific prescribed fire project for management and implementation personnel</li>
            <li>a process that can be used to identify Prescribed Fire Plan elements or characteristics that may pose special problems or concerns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.nwcg.gov/sites/default/files/products/pms424.pdf" target="_blank" title="Prescribed Fire Complexity Rating Guide" alt="Prescribed Fire Complexity Rating Guide">Prescribed Fire Complexity Rating Guide</a> was developed to assist personnel in determining a relative complexity of any single prescribed fire project.</p>
        <p>The Summary Complexity Rating Rationale:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>will clearly justify the summary rating for prescribed fire organization and Prescribed Fire Burn Boss level</li>
            <li>must identify those risks from the Complexity Analysis (Appendix C) that are rated high and cannot be mitigated and will provide a discussion of the risks associated</li>
        </ul>
