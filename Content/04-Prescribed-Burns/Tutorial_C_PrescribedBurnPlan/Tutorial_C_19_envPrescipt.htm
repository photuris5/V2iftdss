        <h2>Environmental and Fire Behavior Prescription (Element 7)</h2>
        <p>Prescription is defined as “the measurable criteria that define a range of conditions during which a prescribed fire may be ignited and held as a prescribed fire.”</p>
        <p>The burn plan environmental prescription will describe: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a range of low to high limits for the environmental (weather, topography, fuels, etc.) parameters</li>
            <li>a set of maximum fire behavior parameters in case of escape<ul><li>hottest, driest, windiest prescription limits</li><li>Most extreme environmental conditions (slope, aspect)</li></ul></li>
            <li>a range of optimal fire behavior parameters</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size: 9pt;">(USDA and U.S. DOI, 2014, p. 28)</p>
        <p>
            <br />Now that the burn objectives are established, we can create a range of environmental parameters that will be used when modeling potential fire behavior and effects.</p>
        <p>Each module has its own set of unique environmental input parameters.</p>
        <p>The next step is to navigate to <b>Element 7: Prescription</b>, in the “Create a burn plan document” template.</p>
        <p>Once you navigate to <b>Element 7: Prescription</b>, fill in the Environmental Prescription.</p>
        <p>Now that the objectives (Element 5) are established, we can use the <b>Prescribed Burn Planning Workflow</b> to model potential fire behavior and effects.</p>

        <p>Element 7 has an “Import Data” feature. While using the Prescribed Burn Planning Workflow to model potential fire behavior and effects, you can tag the outputs of your model runs for use in Element 7.</p>
        <p>After creating and tagging model runs, return to Element 7 of the prescribed burn plan and populate your environmental and fire behavior prescription with the model run outputs.</p>

            <p>You have several tools to choose from for fire behavior and effects modeling.</p>
            <p>In this example, we use Surface fire behavior (IFT-surface), Crown scorch height (IFT-scorch), and probability of ignition (IFT-ignite) for our Prescription (Element 7).</p>
