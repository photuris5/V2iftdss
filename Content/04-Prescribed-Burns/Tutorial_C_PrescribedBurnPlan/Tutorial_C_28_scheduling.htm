        <p><b>Pre-burn Considerations and Weather</b>
        </p>
        <p>Describe the onsite and offsite actions to be conducted and considerations to be addressed prior to implementation.  Describe any fuel sampling and weather data that may need to be obtained.</p>
        <p>The plan will include a list of organizations and individuals that are notified prior to ignition, with contact information for each organization and individual.</p>

        <p><b>Briefing</b>
        </p>
        <p>All assigned personnel must be briefed at the beginning of each operational period to ensure personnel safety.</p>
        <p>Prescribed fire objectives and operations must be clearly defined and understood.</p>
        <p>The briefing checklist should list briefing topics only, not re-state what is listed in the Prescribed Fire Plan for that element.</p>
        <p>The Prescribed Fire Burn Boss is to ensure that any new personnel arriving at the prescribed fire site receives a briefing prior to assignment.</p>
