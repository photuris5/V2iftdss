        <h2>Element 7 - Environmental and Fire Behavior Prescription</h2>
        <p>Prescription is defined as “the measurable criteria that define a range of conditions during which a prescribed fire may be ignited and held as a prescribed fire.”</p>
        <p>The burn plan environmental prescription will describe: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a range of low to high limits for the environmental (weather, topography, fuels, etc.) parameters</li>
            <li>a set of maximum fire behavior parameters in case of escape<ul><li>hottest, driest, windiest prescription limits</li><li>Most extreme environmental conditions (slope, aspect)</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size: 9pt;">(USDA and U.S. DOI, 2014, p. 28)</p>
        <p>Once you navigate to <b>Element 7: Prescription</b>, fill in the Environmental Prescription, including environmental parameters, inputs, and outputs you have determined from Behave.</p>

            <p>You have no available data sets to import data from because you have not run any fire behavior modules within IFTDSS. Once you run fire behavior in one of the IFTDSS&#160;Prescribed Burn Planning Workflow pathways, you will have outputs to import into Element 7.</p>
            <p>IFTDSS contains an 'Import Data' feature. While not used in the exercise, it allows for the easy import of prescription data from other runs conducted in IFTDSS. It is described in more detail under Tutorial C of the IFTDSS online help. </p>
