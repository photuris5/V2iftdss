        <h2>Modeling Considerations</h2>
        <p>Models are based on simplified assumptions, such as uniform fuel and steady-state fire spread.</p>
        <p>Rather than basing your burn plan prescription solely on modeling, the USDA and U.S. DOI (2014) allows for the use of empirical evidence (historical evidence or researched data) and judgment.  These can be used to identify or corroborate prescriptions.</p>
        <p>Weaknesses in modeling can be overridden, but must be justified with empirical evidence and/or verified actual fire behavior.</p>
