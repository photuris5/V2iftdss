        <h2>Appendix D: Agency-Specific Job Hazard Analysis</h2>
        <p>A job hazard analysis is a technique that focuses on job tasks as a way to identify hazards before they occur.<img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_C_PrescribedBurnPlan/tutorial_c_appendices12.png" style="float: right;vertical-align: text-top;width: 375px;height: 493px;margin-left: 3px;" /></p>
        <p>This analysis focuses on the relationship between the worker, the task, the tools, and the work environment.</p>
        <p>Ideally, after you identify uncontrolled hazards, you will take steps to eliminate or reduce those hazards to an acceptable risk level.</p>
        <p>The Job Hazard Analysis for your burn unit may also be cut and pasted into this step after the burn plan has been generated.</p>
