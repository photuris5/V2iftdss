        <p>Some Elements cannot be completed until after the burn plan is finished (Elements 1, 2, 3, and 10). IFTDSS contains tools for modeling fire behavior and fire effects; these tools are useful in obtaining information needed to address Elements 3, 4, 5, 7, 15, 16, 17, and 19. For this course you will be using tools outside of IFTDSS to model fire behavior and fire effects.</p>
        <p>The following pages step through each Element.</p>
