        <h2>Element 4 - Description of the Prescribed Fire Area</h2>
        <p>This section describes the physical features in and around the prescribed fire project area. There are 8 different text boxes to help you describe your project area. They include:&#160;</p>
        <h3>Physical Description</h3>
        <p>The physical description provides information on the various physical aspects of the area where the prescribed burn is to be made.</p>
        <p><b>Location: </b>Narrative description of the location of the prescribed fire project, including a legal description, UTM and/or latitude/longitude, county, and state.</p>
        <p><b>Size:</b> Area, in acres, of the prescribed fire project, with a breakdown by prescribed fire unit and/or ownership if applicable.</p>
        <p><b>Topography:</b> Identifies the upper and lower range of elevation, slopes (max/min/avg), and aspect(s).</p>
        <p><b>Project  Area:</b> Defines the area where fire will be ignited and may be allowed to burn. Describes the physical, natural, and/or human made boundaries .Defines through maps; may include narratives .</p>

        <p>Describe  the structure and composition of the vegetation type(s) and fuel characteristics.<br /></p>
        <p>Describe the percent of the unit composed of each vegetation type  and the corresponding fuel model(s).<br /></p>
        <p>Identify conditions (fuels, slope, aspect) in and adjacent to boundaries that may be a potential <br />threat for escaped fire.</p>
        <h3>Description of Unique Features</h3>
        <p>List and discuss special features, hazards, regulations, issues, constraints, etc.</p>

                    <p class="noteBody">  For this course you will use the provided course materials to determine the spatial features of the burn unit and produce maps of the project area, areas of concern etc. However, when creating burn plans on your own, you can use the "acquire LANDFIRE data" feature and use the IFTDSS Data Studio to visualize the spatial features of the burn unit as well as make maps.</p>
