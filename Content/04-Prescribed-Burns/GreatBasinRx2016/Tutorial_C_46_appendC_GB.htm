        <h2>Appendix C:&#160;Complexity Analysis</h2>
        <p>Once you generate your burn plan you will have access to Appendix C: Complexity Analysis. Using this worksheet and the descriptors from the Prescribed Fire Complexity Rating System Guide you will be able to populate Element 3. The complexity analysis contains 14 elements with three factors to consider for each element:</p>
        <p>In this step you will fill out the complexity analysis and summarize findings at the end.  The final ratings populate Element 3. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Factor 1 is <b>Risk</b>:  the probability an adverse event will occur.</li>
            <li>Factor 2 is <b>Potential Consequences</b>:  the measure of cost/result of an adverse event.</li>
            <li>Factor 3 is <b>Technical Difficulty</b>:  the skill needed to implement the burn and deal with potential adverse events.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Values are assigned for each of the factors:  low, moderate, or high.</p>
