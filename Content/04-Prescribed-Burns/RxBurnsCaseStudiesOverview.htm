        <p>To illustrate how to use the prescribed burn workflow in IFTDSS to complete a burn plan, we have prepared some tutorials that walk through some workflows in IFTDSS. </p>
        <p><a href="RxBurnsCase1.htm">Assessing Fire Hazard for  Prescribed Burn Planning</a> walks through how to use the hazard analysis workflow in IFTDSS to identify areas that warrant further analysis based on potential fire hazard.  The tutorial covers:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Acquiring LANDFIRE data and setting up a project in IFTDSS</li>
            <li>Creating a run for fire behavior across a landscape (IFT-FlamMap)</li>
            <li>Examining data using Google Earth</li>
            <li>Identifying potential fire hazards outside of a burn unit to help develop holding and contingency plans</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="RxBurnsCase2.htm">Preparing a Prescribed Burn Plan</a> walks through the preparation of a burn plan document:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Setting up a project in IFTDSS</li>
            <li>Creating and filling in the burn plan template</li>
            <li>Establishing burn objectives and environmental thresholds</li>
            <li>Using the Prescribed Burn Planning Workflow</li>
            <li>Generating and saving data and maps to include in the burn plan document</li>
            <li>Generating the burn plan as a Microsoft Word document and customizing the plan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, a webinar, <strong>Using IFTDSS for Prescribed Burn Planning and Documentation</strong>, was presented on April 11, 2012. For a link to that and other webinars, see <a href="../02-Getting-Started/GettingStarted.htm">Getting Started</a>.</p>
