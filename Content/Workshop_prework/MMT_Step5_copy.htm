        <h2>Set Up Project Area of Interest</h2>
        <p>The next window is the <b>Set up Project Area of Interest</b> window. We'll provide coordinates to use with this tutorial shortly, but first, take a couple minutes to familiarize yourself with the steps of setting up a project. To begin:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Chose a name for the data set using the <b>Data Set Name</b>box.</li>
            <li>Choose a LANDFIRE version. LANDFIRE 2010 is the latest version available in IFTDSS and the default setting. These tutorials use LANDFIRE 2010</li>
            <li>Choose between the Scott and Burgan 40 and the Anderson 13 fuel models. This tutorial uses the Scott and Burgan 40 fuel models.</li>
            <li>Define a landscape extent by either:<ol><li>Selecting the latitude for the north and south extent and the longitude for the east and west extent and populating the appropriate coordinate boxes.</li><li>Or drawing a box to define the landscape extent directly on the map by choosing the <b>Draw Box</b> radio button.</li></ol></li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <div>
            <form>
                <fieldset class="note">
                    <legend>&#160;&#160;&#160;Note&#160;&#160;&#160;</legend>
                    <p class="noteBody">By clicking the plus icon to the right of the map, you can toggle between satellite, street, and topographic map views.</p>
                </fieldset>
            </form>
        </div>
        <p>If using the <b>Draw Box</b> method the user would place the cursor at the top left-hand corner of the desired area and hold down the left mouse button while dragging the box to the lower right-hand corner of the desired area and releasing the mouse button. If a mistake is made in drawing a box, simply reposition the cursor and repeat the process until you are satisfied with the extent.</p>
        <p>Users can manipulate the map view by selecting the <b>Navigate Map</b> radio button at the upper left of the map. This makes the navigation tools active.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pan by clicking the left mouse button and holding it, and sliding the mouse in the direction you wish to move the map.</li>
            <li>The zoom in and out, + and – buttons <img src="../Resources/Images/Tutorial_Minimum_Travel_Time/2_0_tut_mtt_cap9.png" style="width: 19px;height: 33px;" />   can be used to change the map view extent.</li>
            <li>The arrows <img src="../Resources/Images/Tutorial_Minimum_Travel_Time/2_0_tut_mtt_cap10.png" />   can also be used to pan around the map view.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>If you wish to return to the North American extent simply delete the north, south, east and west coordinates in the boxes and the North American view will appear again.</p>
        <p>Clicking the world    button <img src="../Resources/Images/Tutorial_Minimum_Travel_Time/2_0_tut_mtt_cap12.png" /> will take you to a full world view.</p>
        <p>The project extent is not final until the <b>Next</b> button is selected. Keep in mind IFTDSS is limited to a 400,000 acre landscape extent. Your landscape size is displayed at the upper right of the map view. Larger landscape extents require more computational processing thus more time for processing each run.</p>
        <p>For these tutorials we will select the following the following coordinates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> North: 44.9577528</li>
            <li>West: -109.7485415</li>
            <li> East: -109.5630013</li>
            <li>South: 44.8257449</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <form>
                <fieldset class="note">
                    <legend>&#160;&#160;&#160;Note&#160;&#160;&#160;</legend>
                    <p class="noteBody">Be sure to use the – (negative) at the beginning of your west and east coordinates.</p>
                </fieldset>
            </form>
        </div>
        <p>Once the above coordinates are entered select <b>Next</b>. After the data is acquired a dialogue box will appear at the top of the page to confirm that data has been downloaded. </p>
