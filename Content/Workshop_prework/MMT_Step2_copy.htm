        <h2>Creating a New Run</h2>
        <p>From the IFTDSS&#160;Dashboard, go to the project summary page for the project in which you are working. This is done via the <b>Projects tab</b>, or the <b>Manage My Projects</b> link.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>From the <b>Project Summary Page</b> select <b>Create a New Run</b>, and choose the type of run you would like to initiate. You may access MTT through either the <b>Hazard Analysis</b> or <b>Fuels Treatment</b> pathways. The hazard analysis pathway allows a single MTT run while the <b>Fuels Treatment</b> pathway allows the user to run both a pre and post-treatment analysis within the same run that can be compared on a single map page. For this tutorial, we will choose the <b>Fuels Treatment</b> pathway.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Choosing either pathway will require clicking through several steps.  For this example, choose the <b>Fuels Treatment pathway&gt;Fuels Treatment across the Landscape&gt;LANDFIRE</b> and then select the <b>Manual treatment location (user-defined treatments) (IFT-MTT)</b> model run.</p>

        </p>
        <p>On the <b>Set up</b> page, you will name the run, and have the opportunity to change the extent. By default, runs will use the same extent as the project area of interest. However, you may make runs that are smaller than the project area of interest (but not larger). For this tutorial, we will leave the extent at its default setting.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Give the run a descriptive name, such as 'Squaw Crk. Rx Fire Landscape' and click <b>Next</b>.</p>
