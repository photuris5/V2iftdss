			Welcome to the Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System (IFTDSS).  IFTDSS is a web-based model and data integration framework that organizes previously existing and newly developed fire and fuels software applications to make fuels treatment planning and analysis more efficient and effective. IFTDSS has been developed <i>for</i>fuels treatment specialists <i>by</i> fuels treatment specialists.</p>

        <p>Introduction to IFTDSS:&#160;<iframe type="text/html" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7NzwHCjJws" frameborder="0" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p>
        <h2><a name="Inceptio"></a>Inception</h2>
        <p>In 2007, the NWCG and many others presented the JFSP with a persistent problem: namely, that the proliferation of unconnected, partially redundant, and often unverified models and software systems for fire and fuels management was causing confusion and inefficiencies. Hundreds of standalone software systems, each with unique user interfaces, require a substantial amount of time to learn. Furthermore, the amount of time spent on data transformations among models is often greater than the amount of time spent on analysis.</p>
        <p>  IFTDSS is a result of the Software Tools and Systems study conducted by the JFSP to look into these issues. All project planning and accomplishment documents are published at <a href="http://www.frames.gov/ift-dss">www.frames.gov/ift-dss</a>. </p>
        <p>For a brief, readable overview of IFTDSS, please see <a href="http://www.firescience.gov/Digest/FSdigest7.pdf" title="An article about IFTDSS" alt="An article about IFTDSS" style="font-style: italic;"><MadCap:keyword term="A Powerful New Planning Environment for Fuels Managers the Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System" />A Powerful New Planning Environment for Fuels Managers: the Interagency Fuels Treatment Decision Support System</a> in the December 2009 issue of <i>Fire Science Digest</i><MadCap:keyword term="Fire Science Digest:IFTDSS and" />.</p>
        <h2><a name="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h2>
        <p>Because IFTDSS provides a single portal for access to several sources of data and models for fuels treatment planning, it conveys a number of benefits and solutions. Some of the highlights of IFTDSS are that it</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>reduces or eliminates the amount of time a user needs to spend learning new interfaces and transforming data.</li>
            <li>provides workflows that organize the business needs of fuels treatment planners.</li>
            <li>makes it easy for planners to efficiently reuse and share their work products.</li>
            <li>provides a consistent analysis framework for all users.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Current"></a>Status</h2>
        <p>As of October 2012, the current version of IFTDSS is version 2.0. This version is available for testing and evaluation by members of the various cooperating stakeholder groups.</p>
        <p>Extensive guidance by a broad range of fuels treatment specialists over the last three years has resulted in the identification of five critically important workflow  processes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="../04-Prescribed-Burns/RxBurnsIntro.htm">Prescribed burn planning and burn plan development</a>;</li>
            <li><a href="../05-Hazard-Analysis/sti_hazard_pre2014/HazAnIntro.htm">Wildfire hazard analysis across a landscape of interest</a>;</li>
            <li><a href="../06-Risk-Assessment/risk_original/RiskAssessIntro.htm">Landscape wildfire risk assessments for current conditions</a>;</li>
            <li>Landscape wildfire risk assessment for simulated and treated future landscape conditions; and</li>
            <li>Assessing fuels treatment effectiveness over time. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Feedback"></a>Providing Feedback</h2>
        <p>If you have any issues using the system or if you have suggestions for improvements, please submit your feedback to the IFTDSS development team using the IFTDSS feedback link in the upper right corner of any screen.</p>
        <h2><a name="Stakehol"></a>Stakeholders</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="acknowledgments;stakeholders" />Many individuals have contributed to the IFTDSS software development effort. We greatly appreciate the support and guidance provided by John Cissel, the JFSP program manager. Erik Christiansen, Chair of the Fuels Management Committee (FMC), provided key help and support for analyzing the fuels treatment process that is a struggle for specialists from all agencies. The JFSP Fuels Treatment Working Group (FTWG)—Michael Beasely, Dennis Dupuis, Mark Finney, Glen Gibson, Randi Jandt, David Peterson, Tessa Nicolet, and Brad Reed—has guided our work and provided initial critique and innovative ideas for the project. The JFSP Software Tools and Systems Study Advisory Committee—Pat Andrews, Nate Benson, Mike Hilbruner, Mike Hutt, David Peterson, Carol Saras, Paul Schlobohm, Shari Shetler, and Tim Swedberg—has kept the study headed in the right direction and made sure that all of the various components of a successful solution were considered.</p>
        <p>We would like to specifically acknowledge the fuels treatment specialists who have agreed to participate in this effort to serve as the IFTDSS proof of concept (POC) Test User Group—Brad Reed, Brenda Wilmore, Eric Miller, Gary Curcio, Gary Fildes, Gwen Lipp, Jim Roessler, Jon Wallace, Jonathan Olsen, Karen Folger, Mack McFarland, Nikia Hernandez, Perry Grissom, Randi Jandt, Randy Stiplin, Scott Weyenberg, Sean McEldery, Tessa Nicolet, Alison Forrestel, Brian Sorbel, Daniel Rasmussen, Dennis Fiore, Dennis Page, Glenn Gibson, Jeremy Spetter, Joshua Keown, Kim Kelly, Kyle Jacobson, Loretta Duke, Mike Uebel, Sam Amato, Anna Payne, Dave Pergolski, Jennifer Croft, Jeremy Bennet, John Washington, Ken Rodgers, Mathew Weldon, Paul Maday, Rance Marquez, Albert Savage, William Aney, Yanu Gallimore, Lauren Miller, and Kristen Allison—who have provided, and will continue to provide, valuable feedback regarding the functionality and usability of the IFTDSS. We also thank the broader group of 49 field fuels treatment specialists who helped develop and refine the fuels treatment decision support process.</p>
        <p>We would like to express our appreciation of the fire and fuels science and software development community—Eric Twombly, Mark Finney, Joe Scott, Alan Ager, Nick Crookston, Larry Gangi, Woodham Chung, Kurt Kruger—for their cooperation and feedback related to integrating data and software applications that will be a part of the IFTDSS. Thank you also to the FERA team of Dave Petersen, Roger Ottmar, Susan Prichard, Paige Eagle, and Kjell Swedin for their support and assistance implementing new software modules into the IFTDSS. We would also like to acknowledge the managers of the WFDSS—Tom Zimmerman, Rob Seli, Mitch Burgard and their development team—and the BlueSky Framework—Sim Larkin—for their willingness to work collaboratively to develop software systems that can communicate with one another to create efficiencies in the fire and fuels domain.</p>
        <p>We would also like to thank the IT specialists who helped ensure that we have considered agency IT requirements—Brad Harwood, Laura Hill, John Gebhardt, and John Noneman. All of these groups constitute the stakeholders whose jobs will be positively affected by the results of this project. It will take long-term attention and energy from these groups of stakeholders, and from others yet to be engaged, to create an effective community of interest that will ensure that the IFTDSS helps all of us do our jobs better.</p>
