        <h1>Fuels Treatment</h1>

            <img src="../Resources/Images/MTT_Fuels_Treatment_pre_post.png" style="float: right;padding-left: 20px;padding-bottom: 12px; width: 400px; height: auto;" title="Predicted fire growth before and after fuels treatment." alt="Fire growth is greatly reduced after prescribed burn treatment." />You can use the IFTDSS spatial fuels treatment across a landscape pathways to assess where to locate fuels treatments and to evaluate how effective fuels treatments are at mitigating fire behavior potentials in a spatial context.</p>
        <p>The image the right illustrates one kind of map IFTDSS can create for such assessments. The left half of the image shows predicted fire growth in an area without fuels treatment; the right half shows predicted fire growth in the same area after a set of prescribed burn treatments.</p>
        <p>The output from the fuels treatment workflow can be useful for</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identifying where fuels treatments may have the greatest influence for mitigating wildland fire at the stand or landscape scale.</li>
            <li>Investigating the potential effectiveness of fuels treatments across spatial and temporal scales.</li>
            <li>Providing tools and processes for fuels treatment planners to evaluate potential fuels treatment options, including no treatment, pile and burning, thin from below, thin by DBH, pile burn surface fuel, and prescribed burn at the stand level.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> To make these assessments, you use a set of tools in IFTDSS to manually edit a LANDFIRE .lcp file. With these tools, you can create a fuels treatment polygon and alter values (fuel model, canopy height, canopy base height, canopy bulk density, and canopy coverage) within that polygon to reflect a fuels treatment.</p>
        <p>After creating and configuring these polygons, you then run spatial fire behavior modules such as IFT-FlamMap, IFT-MTT, and IFT-RANDIG across the untreated and treated landscape to compare possible effects of treating the fuels on subsequent fire behavior, fire growth, and burn probability.</p>
        <p>IFTDSS produces digital maps of percent difference for fire behavior parameters to identify where positive and negative changes have occurred across the landscape due to modeled fuels treatments.</p>
