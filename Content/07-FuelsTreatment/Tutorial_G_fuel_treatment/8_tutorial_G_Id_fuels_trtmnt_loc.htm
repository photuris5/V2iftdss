        <h1>Identifying Fuels Treatment Locations</h1>
        <p>In this example, the areas with a low rate of spread (green pixels in upper left screenshot) are at risk for canopy fires (red pixels in lower right screenshot).</p>
        <p>We would like to reduce the risk of canopy fires near the wildland urban interface (gray pixels at bottom of screenshot).</p>
        <p>We have identified our first fuels treatment location (circled in blue). Our objective will be to reduce canopy fire potential in the area surrounding the wildland urban interface.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Looking to the east of the map we can see U.S. Highway 101 (outlined in light blue), this will be our next fuels treatment location. Specifically, the  grassland/oak woodland buffer along the highway. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_G_2015/2_0_1_G_outputs_4.png" alt="U.S. Highway 101, in the eastern region of the map, will be our next fuels treatment location." style="width: 714px; height: 652px;" class="img_2" />
        </p>
        <p>Our fuels treatment objective will be to reduce the potential rate of spread adjacent to Highway 101 in order to decrease the likelihood of human-caused fire along the roadside, and to lower the risk of a wildfire jumping the highway.</p>
        <p>Lastly, our third fuels treatment location will be Gnoss Field (the Marin County Airport). This area is classified by a mix of brush, chaparral, and short grass (Fuel models 5,4, and 1) and has the potential to reach flame lengths greater than 32 feet.</p>
        <p>The objective of this fuels treatment (circled in blue) is to reduce the potential flame lengths near the Marin County Airport.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Based on these observations, our goals will be to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce canopy fire potential in the area surrounding the wildland urban interface.</li>
            <li>Reduce the potential rate of spread adjacent to Highway 101.</li>
            <li>Reduce the potential flame lengths near the Marin County Airport.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the next steps we will add the fuels treatments polygons and edit the LANDFIRE&#160;fuels data within those polygons to create fuels treatments. </p>
