        <h1>Evaluating Fuel Treatment Effectiveness</h1>
        <p>Now you are on the Post-Treatment Outputs step. This is the part of the run in which we can compare the pre-treatment fire behavior, with the post-treatment fire behavior.</p>
        <p>On the <b>Layers</b> box on the left side of map, you will notice in addition to our inputs, we now have fire behavior attributes for: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flammap post treatment</li>
            <li>Flammap pre treatment</li>
            <li>Differences (this display the change between the two Flammap layers).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We'll review the treatment goals, use these outputs to evaluate the effectiveness for each treatment polygon below</p>
        <h2>Thinning Effectiveness</h2>
        <p>The goal for the <b>Thin from below</b> treatment area was to reduce canopy fire potential in theh area surrounding the wildland urban interface</p>
        <p>The Thin from Below fuels treatment was effective in reducing canopy fire potential surrounding the wildland urban interface.</p>
        <p>A majority of the canopy fire (red) and torching (orange) pixels were reduced to surface fire (yellow) following the fuels treatment.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Mowing Effectiveness</h2>
        <p>The goal for the Mowing treatment was to reduce the potential rate of spread adjacent to Highway 101. Evaluating the <b>Differences Rate of Spread</b> layer, the map shows that the change in the rate of spread is negative. Therefore, the mowing fuels treatment was effective in reducing the potential rate of spread adjacent to Highway 101.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Prescribed Fire Effectiveness</h2>
        <p>The goal for the Prescribed Fire treatment was to reduce the potential flame lengths near the Marin County Airport. The map shows a 90% to 100% reduction in flame length in the treatment unit. The Prescribed Fire fuels treatment was effective in reducing the potential flame lengths near the Marin County Airport.</p>
