        <h1>Creating Fuels Treatment Polygons</h1>
        <p>In the next few steps fuels treatments will be created by drawing polygons and editing the LANDFIRE data. </p>
        <p>There are two methods for using the map tools to draw polygons:</p>
        <p>1. The Freeform Drawing Method is useful when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You want to quickly and easily draw polygons</li>
            <li>You have a small area of interest</li>
            <li>You can see the entire area that your polygon will encompass without moving the map</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. The Point and Click Method is useful when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You want to zoom in to make a detailed polygon</li>
            <li>You need to move the map (using the pan tool) while you are drawing a polygon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>To create a polygon using the freeform method</h2>
        <p> First, we will create a treatment polygon in which to reduce crown fire potential in south western corner of the map near the wildland urban interface. This is done by:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Click the draw polygon tool in the map toolbar</li>
            <li>Hold down the shift button, move the mouse to where you want your polygon to begin, then hold down the left mouse button to draw your perimeter. When you have encircled the area, let go of both shift and the mouse key, and an edit feature box will appear</li>
            <li>Name the polygon, for this example we will name the polygon 'Thin from below' as this will be the proposed treatment method. </li>
            <li>Change the color if desired by clicking on the color wheel</li>
            <li>When your ready, click submit</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>To create a polygon using the point and click method</h2>
        <p>For this example we will create a treatment polygon in which to reduce rates of spread along Highway 101. To create this polygon:&#160;</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>Click the draw polygon tool in the map toolbar</li>
            <li>Move the mouse to where you want your polygon to begin, then left click to place your first anchor point. Scroll to the next point, click, and continue to dray your polygon. When you have closed your polygon, double click and mouse, and an edit feature box will appear</li>
            <li>Name the polygon, for this example we will name the polygon 'Mowing' as this will be the proposed treatment method. </li>
            <li>Change the color if desired by clicking on the color wheel</li>
            <li>When your ready, click submit</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_G_2015/2_0_1_G_polygon_2.png" alt="The 'edit feature' window and a polygon being created using the point and click method as described in the text." class="img_2" style="width: 700px;height: 390px;" />
        </p>
        <h2>Prescribed fire treatment polygon</h2>
        <p>Use either of the above methods to create a treatment area in the north east corner of the map (circled in blue). This goal for this area will be to reduce flame lengths by treating the area with prescribed fire. Name the polygon 'Prescribed fire'.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_G_2015/2_0_1_G_outputs_5.png" style="width: 368px; height: 258px;" alt="A treatment area in the north east corner of the map." class="img_2" />
        </p>
        <p>When you are completed, your polygons will look similar to the image below:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_G_2015/2_0_1_G_polygon_example.png" style="width: 355px; height: 293px;" alt="The area of interest, showing all of the treatment polygons." class="img_2" />
        </p>
        <p>When all three treatment areas are represented by polygons, name this collection of polygons (in this example we will name the 'Olompali fuel treatments' and click submit (circled in red).</p>
        <p>
