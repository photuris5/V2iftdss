        <p>The consumption, emissions, and tree mortality modules  can be used to predict fuel consumption, emissions, tree mortality, and smoke production for individual stands.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Fuel loading and moisture information must be provided as input.</li>
            <li> Outputs include consumption by fuel type and emissions by air pollutant.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Consumption and Emissions</h2>
        <p>You can use the consumption and emissions module to predict fuel consumption, emissions, and smoke production caused by a prescribed fire or wildfire.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li> Input variables include forest floor characteristics, fuel loading and moisture values, and percentage of crown burn.</li>
            <li> Output variables include the amount of fuel consumed by size categories and the amount of emissions generated from flaming and smoldering fires.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tree Mortality</h2>
        <p>You can use the tree mortality module  to predict tree mortality caused by a prescribed fire or wildfire.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li> Input variables include tree characteristics (e.g., species, DBH, height, and crown ratio) and fire characteristics (e.g., flame length and scorch length).</li>
            <li>Output variables include post-fire stand density, number of trees killed by fire, and various other tree mortality statistics.</li>
        </ul>
