        <p>In the risk assessment using the worst-case flame lengths approach, potential fire hazard and risk is simulated using the <a href="RefRAN.htm">IFT-FlamMap-RANDIG burn probability simulator</a> and the <a href="RefFlamMap.htm">IFT-FlamMap fire behavior module</a>.  In this approach, risk is quantified using the net value change concepts outlined in Finney <a href="Bibliography.htm#Finney2005">(2005)</a> and Calkin et al. (<a href="Bibliography.htm#Calkinetal2010a">2010a)</a>.</p>
        <p>Potential risk is defined as the expected net value change within an area based on</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the probability that the area represented by the pixel will burn given a random ignition within the project  area, and</li>
            <li>the resulting change in financial or ecological value (response function) if the area represented by the pixel burns with a specific flame length</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This approach is referred to as the “worst case” estimation of fire risk  because it is based on a single IFT-FlamMap  run, where the areas represented by every pixel are all always assumed to burn under the worst case (i.e., by a head fire).</p>
