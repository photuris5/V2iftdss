        <p>With IFT-FlamMap, IFTDSS provides tools for calculating potential fire behavior using surface fire behavior. The spatial fire behavior outputs provide information about the distribution of possible fire behaviors across an area of interest. This information, when coupled with estimates of tree mortality, fuels consumption, soil heating, and emissions (from fire effects models), provides the fuels treatment specialist with a range of spatial data to use in assessing potential fire hazard across a landscape.</p>

The burning potential of the pixel, or point location, being assessed is not affected by fire behavior in adjacent locations, roads, or hazardous fuel types in proximity to the area under assessment.</p>

        <p>IFT-FlamMap provides digital maps of output regarding surface fire behavior  across an area of interest. These maps can be exported to your local computer as image files or exported to Google Earth as .kml files. An example map is provided here to illustrate potential output products and how this type of analysis may be used.</p>
        <p>The example map illustrates the use of fire behavior output to identify potential fire hazard. Areas that would not warrant further investigation are shown in green, while areas with high fire hazard potentials are shown in red.</p>

        <p><em>Map illustrating use of fire behavior output to identify potential fire hazard. Each fireline intensity value (green, light green, orange, and red) represents a level of attack familiar to fire fighters—green represents conditions where direct attack may be feasible, while red refers to conditions where only indirect means of attack are warranted (Keane et al., <a href="Bibliography.htm#Keaneetal2010">2010</a>).</em>

            <MadCap:keyword term="hazard analysis:prescribed burn planning and;prescribed burn plans:hazard analysis and" />The output from a hazard analysis may also be useful for prescribed burn planning to assess the potential fire hazard in the areas within and adjacent to a planned burn unit.</p>
