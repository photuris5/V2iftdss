        <p>All modules implemented in IFTDSS undergo two types of testing:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Scientific testing to ensure that the outputs produced by the module are consistent with a range of expected values generated by the native desktop software application and/or provided by the scientific module developer(s).  These tests include comparisons for a range of predefined scenarios developed to exercise different parts of the module.</li>
            <li>Software testing to ensure that the module is functioning from a usability perspective, accepting inputs, and producing outputs without generating software error reports.  These automatic tests also ensure that as updates are made to the modules or modeling framework, each individual module produces correct data values.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The documents in this section describe Sonoma Technology, Inc.’s test cases for the modules implemented in IFTDSS. PDFs of the test case information spreadsheets  are also included.</p>
