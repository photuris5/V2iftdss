            <MadCap:keyword term="LANDFIRE" />LANDFIRE</h1>
        <p>The Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) is an interagency vegetation, fire, and fuel characteristics mapping program sponsored by the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) and the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USDA Forest Service).</p>
        <p>LANDFIRE was initiated to respond to agencies’ needs for mapped data that support prioritization of hazardous fuel reduction and ecological conservation activities and also support strategic resource management initiatives.  Since LANDFIRE began in 2004, an expanded range of land management uses of LANDFIRE data products has surfaced.  These new uses include climate change research, carbon sequestration planning, ecoregional assessments, and ongoing fire management planning initiatives.</p>
        <h2>Data Products</h2>
        <p>LANDFIRE produces a suite of spatial data for the United States consisting of maps and other information that support a range of land management analysis and modeling activities.  LANDFIRE landscape files are geospatial map layers that represent topography, vegetation, and canopy characteristics. </p>
        <p>Specific data layer products include</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>vegetation types, including canopy and height characteristics</li>
            <li>biophysical settings</li>
            <li>environmental site potential</li>
            <li>fire behavior fuel models</li>
            <li>fire regime classes</li>
            <li>fire effects layers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The LANDFIRE data products are developed by integrating a variety of vegetation data sources, including satellite‐enabled remote sensing data, geo-referenced land‐based plots and polygons representing field conditions, systems ecology, gradient analysis, predictive landscape modeling, and vegetation and disturbance dynamics.</p>
        <p>LANDFIRE national products are available at a 30‐meter grid resolution. </p>
        <h2>Recommendations for Use</h2>
        <p>The most effective use of the LANDFIRE products is at the landscape scale in support of strategic vegetation, fire, and fuels management planning to evaluate management alternatives across boundaries.   LANDFIRE data products also facilitate national‐ and regional‐level strategic planning and reporting of wildland fire and natural resource management activities.</p>
        <p>Applying LANDFIRE data at an individual grid cell level or in small groups of grid cells is not recommended.</p>
        <p> When you are using LANDFIRE data as an analysis starting point, we recommend that the data be inspected (and edited if needed) to ensure that the data are representative of real-world conditions.  Tools and information to assist users of LANDFIRE data are available at <a href="http://www.landfire.gov/products_tools.php">http://www.landfire.gov/products_tools.php</a>.</p>
        <h2>IFTDSS&#160;and LANDFIRE</h2>
        <p>IFTDSS supports LANDFIRE landscape files (.lcp ) and accompanying geographic projection file (.prj).  LANDFIRE landscape files are required as input for several spatial fire behavior modules, such as FlamMap.   In IFTDSS, you can <a href="../03-Concepts/DataSetsLANDFIRE.htm">retrieve LANDFIRE data from the LANDFIRE archive</a> or you can <a href="../03-Concepts/DataSetsUploading.htm">upload your own .lcp and .prj files</a>.</p>
