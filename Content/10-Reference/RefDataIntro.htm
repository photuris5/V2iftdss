        <p>One of the key aspects of IFTDSS is that it provides access to and tools for manipulating and editing different types of vegetation data. IFTDSS supports the following vegetation data sets:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li><a href="RefFuelModelsOverview.htm">Fire behavior fuel models</a>.  IFTDSS supports the Anderson 13 and the Scott and Burgan 40 fuel models when running fire behavior simulations for individual stands.</li>
            <li><a href="RefFCCSData.htm">FCCS  fuelbed files</a> (.xml).  FCCS fuelbeds represent vegetation and fuels characteristics by strata from the ground through the canopy.  FCCS fuelbed data can be used in fire behavior and fire effects modules, such as surface fire behavior for FCCS fuelbeds <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.LaterRelease">; FEPS; </MadCap:conditionalText>and consumption, emissions, and heat release (Consume).  In IFTDSS, you can select from a standard set of FCCS fuelbeds or you can import custom fuelbeds. For additional information on FCCS, see <MadCap:xref href="../08-FERA-Tools/FERA-FCCS.htm"><b>Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS)</b></MadCap:xref>.</li>
            <li><a href="RefLANDFIRE.htm">LANDFIRE</a> landscape files (.lcp ) and accompanying geographic projection file (.prj).  LANDFIRE landscape files are geospatial map layers that represent topography, vegetation, and canopy characteristics.  In IFTDSS, you can retrieve LANDFIRE data from the LANDFIRE archive or you may upload your own .lcp and .prj file.  LANDFIRE landscape files are required as input for several spatial fire behavior modules; for example, <a href="RefFlamMap.htm">IFT-FlamMap</a>.</li>
        </ul>
