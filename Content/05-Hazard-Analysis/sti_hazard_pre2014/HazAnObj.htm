            <MadCap:keyword term="hazard analysis:objectives;fire effects:undesirable:hazard analysis and;fuels treatment:assessing need for" />Overview and Objectives</h1>
        <p>The objective of the hazard analysis workflow is to identify areas of potentially high fire hazard within an area of interest. Use this workflow to identify areas across a landscape where further fuels treatment analysis may be warranted based on potential fire hazard. High fire hazard is expressed by high potential fire behavior and/or undesirable fire effects.</p>
        <p>The identification of areas of potentially high fire hazard is a crucial first step in the fuels and resources planning process. The information from this step can be used with other ecological and natural resource information to rapidly assess areas within the landscape that may warrant fuels treatment. Fire hazard analysis can be viewed as an initial step in the planning process and crosses many geographic scales (e.g., national, district, watershed). </p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="hazard analysis:definitions;fire hazards:definition of term" />In IFTDSS, we follow Hardy's (<a href="../../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Hardy2005">2005</a>) definitions of hazard and risk, where the term "fire hazard" is defined as an act or phenomenon with the potential to do harm (NRC, <a href="../../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#NRC1989">1989</a>; Keeane et al., <a href="../../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Keaneetal2010">2010</a>). Fire hazard in this context is expressed as potential fire behavior (such as flame length) which is related to fuel properties within the area of interest (Keane et al., 2010). Fire hazard is often expressed independently of weather (Hardy, 2005), yet the potential affects of fire on values at risk are influenced by weather and its relationship to fuel moisture. IFTDSS provides tools you can use to evaluate the potential fire hazard across a range of fuel moisture conditions.</p>

                <MadCap:keyword term="fire hazards:consumption, emissions, and tree mortality and;fire behavior (IFT-FlamMap):fire hazards and" />IFTDSS provides tools to assess current fire hazard across an area of interest based on potential fire behavior produced during a single run of the fire behavior module (<a href="../../10-Reference/RefFlamMap.htm">IFT-FlamMap</a>). This module ingests a user-supplied landscape file (.lcp) and outputs a defined set of parameters.</li>
            <li>You can use the burn probability module,  <a href="../../10-Reference/RefRAN.htm">IFT-FlamMap-RANDIG</a>, to simulate burn probability across an entire landscape.  The burn probability module creates raster maps of composite burn probabilities (burn probabilities for all flame lengths) and raster maps of burn probabilities for a set of user-defined flame length classes.  This module can be used for hazard analysis and is an essential component of the <a href="../../06-Risk-Assessment/risk_original/RiskAssessIntro.htm">risk assessment workflow</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The product of a hazard analysis is a digital map of spatially explicit information about the variability of fire hazard across a landscape.</p>
