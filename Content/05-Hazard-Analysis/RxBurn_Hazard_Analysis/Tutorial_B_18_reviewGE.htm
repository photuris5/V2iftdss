        <h2>Reviewing Results in Google Earth</h2>
        <p>In this example, we are going to view our project area with the modeled fire behavior.</p>
        <p>Using the <b>New Polygon</b> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_B_RxBurn/tutorial_B_reviewge1.png" style="width: 40px;height: 26px;" />         feature in Google Earth, we created a polygon around an area that we are interested in burning.  We labeled this polygon “Project Area” using the placemark           <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_B_RxBurn/tutorial_B_reviewge2.png" style="width: 34px;height: 25px;" />feature.</p>
        <p>Now, we will compare our desired fire behavior parameters (surface fire with minimal torching and ≤ 4 foot flame lengths) to the modeled fire behavior within and                                                            outside the project area.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>There are multiple patches of forest predicted to be “torching” fires (top – light orange) within and adjacent to our project area.  There are also several areas where flame lengths are &gt; 4 feet (bottom – yellow, orange, and red).</p>
        <p>This information can help determine areas of concern inside and outside the burn unit.</p>
        <p>Using this information, as well as natural and man-made fire breaks, we are going to create a new polygon within the project area.  This polygon is now the potential Burn Unit.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>You can also view environmental and fire behavior characteristics outside the burn unit which can (1) help you locate critical holding points, vegetation changes, transportation routes, etc. and (2) aid in the development of contingency and holding plans.</p>
        <p>In this example, there is a large patch of forest at risk for torching adjacent to the burn unit (circled).  This information can help with the development of a holding plan.</p>
        <p>Possible actions to reduce the risk of an escaped fire are to establish a wet line along the east boundary and to position a lookout in an area that allows for good viewing of the outside area at risk for torching.</p>
        <p>The small patches of forest at risk for torching within the burn unit may require fuels treatment prior to the burn.</p>
