        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The hazard analysis workflow provides tools to perform a current condition assessment of fire hazard within an area of interest.</p>
        <p>The focus of this workflow is to identify areas that warrant further analysis based on potential fire hazard.</p>
        <p>In IFTDSS, the user can assess potential fire behavior using a fire behavior mapping and analysis software application called Calculate fire behavior across a landscape (IFT-FlamMap).</p>
        <p>The module uses environmental variables, along with spatial landscape data, to compute potential fire behavior characteristics (such as rate of spread, flame length, and fireline intensity) for an entire landscape. You input constant weather and fuel moisture conditions to capture an instant in time.</p>
        <p>High fire hazard is expressed by high potential fire behavior (e.g., flame length, rate of spread, and fireline intensity) and/or undesirable fire effects (e.g., tree mortality and emissions).</p>
        <p>This tutorial walks through the steps needed to assess potential fire hazards within and adjacent to a burn unit using the IFTDSS.</p>
        <p>The output from a hazard analysis can be useful for:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identifying areas across a landscape where further fuels treatment analysis may be warranted.</li>
            <li>Prescribed fire planning to assess the potential fire hazard in the areas within and adjacent to a planned burn unit.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This tutorial focuses on assessing potential fire hazards within and adjacent to a prescribed burn unit using the IFTDSS system.</p>
