        <h2>Identifying Potential Fire Hazards</h2>
        <p>Using information derived from the modeled fire behavior, as well as the spatial landscape data, you can identify potential fire hazard areas within South Lake Tahoe’s Wildland Urban Interface.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In this example, we focus on a number of fire-related descriptors to identify an area where further fuels treatment analysis may be warranted. further fuels treatment analysis may be warranted.</p>
        <p>The forest adjacent to South Tahoe High School (circled on map) is at risk for high flame lengths during red-flag warning weather conditions.  Be sure you have pre-2006 Google imagery selected so you can view the pre-fire vegetation.  Then switch to post-2006 imagery to view the difference.</p>
        <p>Using multiple fire behavior descriptors, it is clear that this forest is at risk for high flame lengths, high fireline intensity, and canopy fire.</p>
        <p>Next, we will review some environmental parameters.</p>

        <p>The circled area is at risk for high flame lengths, high fireline intensity, and canopy fire.  This location also has moderate slopes, high canopy coverage, and low canopy base heights.<img src="../../Resources/Images/Hazard-Analysis/tutorialA_idPotFireHaz3.png" style="float: right;vertical-align: text-top;" /></p>
        <p>After reviewing the modeled fire behavior and spatial landscape data, this is an area that warrants further analysis and may require a site visit and/or fuels treatment.</p>
