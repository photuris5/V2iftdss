        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The hazard analysis workflow provides tools to perform a current condition assessment of fire hazard within an area of interest. The focus of this workflow is to identify areas that warrant further analysis based on potential fire hazard.</p>
        <p>In IFTDSS, you can assess potential fire behavior using a fire behavior mapping and analysis software application called Fire behavior across a landscape (IFT-FlamMap).</p>
        <p>The module uses environmental variables, along with spatial landscape data, to compute potential fire behavior characteristics (such as rate of spread, flame length, and fire-line intensity) for an entire landscape.</p>
        <p>You input constant weather and fuel moisture conditions to capture an instant in time.</p>
        <p>The product of this analysis is a digital map of variability of fire hazard across a landscape.</p>
        <p>The output from a hazard analysis may be useful for:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1"> 1. Identifying areas across a landscape where further fuels treatment analysis may be warranted.</ul>
        <ul class="ul_1">2. Prescribed fire planning to assess the potential fire hazard in the areas within and adjacent to a planned burn unit for contingency planning.</ul>
        <p>The following tutorial focuses on assessing potential fire hazards across a landscape using the IFTDSS system.</p>

                    <p class="noteBody">High fire hazard is expressed by high potential fire behavior (e.g., flame length, rate of spread, and fireline intensity) and/or undesirable fire effects (e.g., tree mortality and emissions).</p>
