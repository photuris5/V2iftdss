        <h2>Post Treatment Outputs</h2>
        <p>The <b>Post Treatment Outputs</b> window will allow the user to view both the pre and post treatment MTT runs as well as <b>Differences</b> (change) outputs.</p>
        <p>You are able to see the treatment made a significant difference to fire spread within the treatment area. Perhaps one of the objectives of this treatment was to protect infrastructure along the highway to the north.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The <b>Differences</b> outputs in the left hand layers menu allow the user to quantify the amount of change the treatment has made on the landscape. Differences are expressed as a range of negative values (decrease in fire behavior) and positive values (increase in fire behavior).  For the image below, we can see there are several places within our treatment polygon that show a negative Fireline Intensity Percentage (indicated in blue).  Fireline intensity decreased in these areas from the Pre-Treatment to Post-Treatment fire behavior outputs due to the Squaw RX Burn.  Fireline intensity decreased at varying rates across the treatment area and actually increased in some spots.  Use the point edit to evaluate why Fireline intensity increased in some pixels post prescribed burn. Take a few moments to click on some pixles using the point edit tool, to bring up the attributes for individual pixels, noting by what percent some of then increase or decrease.</p>

        <p>The <b>Landscape Statistics</b> tool   <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_Minimum_Travel_Time/2_0_tut_mtt_cap26.png" />can also be used to further analyze the pre/post-treatment differences. The <b>Download CSV</b> can be used to export the data into an Excel spreadsheet. The <b>Chart context menu</b><![CDATA[   ]]><img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_Minimum_Travel_Time/2_0_tut_mtt_cap27.png" />can be used to print the chart or download several varieties of images of the chart that can be used in other documents and reports.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Users may also examine values at an individual Pixel level using the <b>Point Info</b> tool <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_Minimum_Travel_Time/2_0_tut_mtt_cap29.png" /> . After selecting the point info tool click on the point of interest and the <b>Point Info</b> panel appears with a list of values for that point (individual pixel) including the output values.</p>

        <p>The <b>Exports</b> tab will allow users to download a KLM file to view the MTT input and output data in Google Earth®. Click the <b>Exports</b> tab on the left hand menu header on the Post Treatment Outputs window and select one of the menu options.<br /></p>

        </p>
        <p>Once the KLM file downloads to your computer you may file it or simply click the file, if you have Google Earth installed on your computer the files will open automatically depending on your browser you may get a confirmation pop-up.</p>
