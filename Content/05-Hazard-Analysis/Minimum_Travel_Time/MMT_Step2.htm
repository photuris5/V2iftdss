        <h2>Creating a New Run</h2>
        <p>Following the creation of a new project, or selecting the option to create a new run, you will be prompted to <b>Choose the type of run you would like to create</b>. Users are required to choose a pathway to access the type of run they would like to evaluate. You may access MTT through either the ”<b>Hazard Analysis</b> or <b>Fuels Treatment</b> pathways. The hazard analysis pathway allows a single MTT run while the <b>Fuels Treatment</b> pathway allows the user to run both a pre and post-treatment analysis within the same run that can be compared on a single map page. For this tutorial, we will choose the <b>Fuels Treatment</b> pathway.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Choosing either pathway will require clicking through several steps. For this example, choose the <b>Fuels Treatment</b> pathway&gt;Fuels Treatment across a Landscape&gt; LANDFIRE to be taken to the list of available runs.</p>
