        <h2>Minimum Travel Time (MTT) Modeling Assessment Introduction:</h2>
        <p>The minimum travel time (MTT) methods allow the user to assess fire growth across a landscape. MTT can be more efficient than other fire spread models in computing fire growth. MTT is particularly well suited to short-range assessments of fire growth where weather conditions are held constant and/or where many simulations from multiple ignition sources are used, such as in fire-risk assessments. MTT is also well suited to assess the effects of fuel treatment optimization, where treatment units are being strategically located to impede fire spread through critical pathways on the landscape.</p>
        <p>MTT produces many useful assessment output parameters.</p>
        <p><b>Arrival Time:</b> A representation of time (fraction of an hour) it takes the fire to reach a location on the landscape from an ignition source. You may think of this as time step perimeters.</p>
        <p><b>Major Flow Paths:</b> Displays the minimum time pathways as the fire moves across the landscape. Just as water flows in a path of least resistance, major flow paths displays the path across the landscape that fire would spread most rapidly.</p>
        <p><b>Flame length, rate of spread, fireline intensity,</b> and <b>crown fire activity</b> outputs are similar to the outputs from other fire behavior models and are useful for assessing the type of fire behavior that can be expected at a particular point or area on the landscape.</p>
        <p><b>All Flow Paths:</b> This displays the minimum time pathways between all nodes on the analysis area.</p>
        <p><b>Rate of Spread (MTT):</b> This displays the rate of spread as a function of the MTT pathways.</p>

        <p>For this tutorial we'll create an example project named run Squaw Creek Rx. We will simulate a prescribed fire treatment on a portion of the landscape and then use MTT to simulate fire spread prior to the burn and then a couple of years after the burn to assess its effectiveness.</p>
