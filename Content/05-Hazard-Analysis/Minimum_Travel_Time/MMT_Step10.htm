        <h2>Barrier</h2>
        <p>Next is the <b>Barrier</b> window. The process of drawing barriers, and saving them, is identical to that of drawing and saving ignition lines.</p>

        <p>You may add features that will be a barrier to fire spread. Barriers are added using an identical process as adding ignitions. Because of the resolution of LANDFIRE fuel models (30 meter pixel), barrier features such as roads, rivers and streams my not be reflected in the fuels data. We traced the county road that runs into our project area feeling that this road is defensible and would act as a barrier to the fire. The barrier window is set-up similar to the ignition window, the barriers can also be saved for use in future runs. The image below shows the location of the ignition and barrier.</p>

        <p>When you click the <b>Next</b> button the pre-treatment MTT will run, be sure you have your run set the way you want before clicking <b>Next</b>. You may use the flow boxes at the top of the window to move back to a previous window if you wish to edit something prior to running MTT.</p>
