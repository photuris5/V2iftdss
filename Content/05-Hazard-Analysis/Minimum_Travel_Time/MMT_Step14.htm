        <h2>Run Summary</h2>
        <p>The last page in the MTT assessment is the <b>Run Summary</b> page. From this page users may copy or download any of the data sets created during the run sequence. Downloads may either be extracted as a shapefile or raster data set.  These download files could be further analyzed and/or displayed in ArcGIS®. Users may also <b>Copy This Run</b>, this allows users the ability to use the same run and tweak input values to look at the effects of different environmental variables such as wind direction or speed or perhaps compare the 97th percentile to the 90th percentile weather or the user can make other landscape edits.</p>
