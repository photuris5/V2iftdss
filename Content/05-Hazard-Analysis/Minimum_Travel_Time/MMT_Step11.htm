        <h2>Outputs</h2>
        <p>The run will take several minutes to process depending the extent of fire spread. The <b>Pre Treatment Output</b> window displays the <b>Fire Arrival Time</b>. We have also activated the <b>Major Flow Paths</b> display as well. You can see the county road barrier stopped fire spread to the east.</p>

        <p>This step allows you to assess and review the minimum travel time and basic fire behavior outputs, and determine where to place treatments that would hinder fire spread or reduce fire behavior to protect values.  In the following step, we'll make edits to the fire behavior fuel model within the prescribed fire polygon, in order to represent the effects of the treatment on fire behavior and spread.</p>
