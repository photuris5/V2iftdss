        <h2>Editing the Landscape</h2>
        <p>At this point we will edit the landscape to reflect the post treatment features. You may also choose to create treatment polygons at this point, but we have already created our Rx treatment polygon earlier in this tutorial.</p>
        <p>For our example we will activate our Squaw Rx polygon by placing a check in the box next to <b>Treatments</b> under <b>Barriers</b> in the left hand layers menu and select the <b>Polygon-based Advanced Edit</b> tool    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_Minimum_Travel_Time/2_0_tut_mtt_cap22.png" /> at the top of the page and click on our polygon. This will open the <b>Edit Feature</b> dialog panel shown below. Here we will change our landscape features. In our example we will change fire behavior fuel models. Because we are assuming this area now represents a prescribed fire a couple of years post treatment we will change all the timber fuel models to a moderate load conifer litter TL3. Because we have areas of grass within our treatment polygon that will likely return within one growing season we will only change TU1 and above to TL3.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Users may choose to change other features such as canopy characteristics to match post treatment features. Multiple features may be edited on each polygon and multiple polygons may also be edited one at a time by selecting the polygon in the <b>Edit Feature</b> dropdown after the previous polygon has completed processing.</p>
        <p>When the <b>Submit</b> button is selected IFTDSS processes the changes to the landscape. Once you have made all your changes selecting the <b>Next</b> button will process the post treatment MTT run.</p>
        <p>Scroll down and click <b>Next</b>.</p>
