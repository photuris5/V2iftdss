        <h2>Review Landscape Data and Create a Fuel Treatment Polygon</h2>
        <p>	After configuring the run we will go to the <b>Review Landscape Data</b> window. At this point we can assess and modify the LANDFIRE data to suit local conditions. The <b>Landscape Statistics</b> tool <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_Minimum_Travel_Time/2_0_tut_mtt_cap13.png" style="width: 31px;height: 29px;" /> can be a powerful tool for assessing the landscape features. The <b>Point Edit</b> tool    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_Minimum_Travel_Time/2_0_tut_mtt_cap14.png" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;" /> can be used to edit one pixel at a time. The user may also draw polygons to be used as masks to modify LANDFIRE data such as a recent fire or completed fuels treatment. You may also draw polygons to be used later as fuel treatment units.  You may also choose to draw your treatment polygons later on the <b>Pre Treatment Output</b> window. You may also add notations or labels to the map using the <b>Map Annotation</b> tool <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_Minimum_Travel_Time/2_0_map_annotation_tool.png" style="width: 31px;height: 25px;" />. </p>
        <p>Use the <b>Draw Polygon</b> tool <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_Minimum_Travel_Time/2_0_tut_mtt_cap15.png" /> to create the Squaw Creek Rx polygon on the landscape as shown on the map below. Use the  <b>Map Annotation</b> tool to label it. </p>

        <p>This polygon will be available to use for the remainder of your run. If you would like to save the polygon in your IFTDSS Datasets to use in other runs, scroll down the <b>Save Polygon As</b> dialogue at the bottom, and give it a descriptive name. It will saved for use in other runs upon clicking <b>Next</b>.</p>
