        <p>The Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) is an easy-to-use software application that provides fire and fuel managers with a consistent, accurate, and efficient way to characterize and classify fuels. You can use FCCS to query and record fuelbed information and to generate numerical inputs to fire behavior, fire effects, and dynamic vegetation models.</p>
        <p>At a high level, FCCS provides tools that</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Store and classify fuels data as FCCS fuelbeds (a set of measured or averaged physical fuel characteristics that represents a distinct fire environment).</li>
            <li>Calculate physical characteristics of fuels based on fuelbed data.</li>
            <li>Allow designation of fuel properties and fire potentials across landscapes.</li>
            <li>Calculate nine FCCS fire potentials based on the intrinsic properties of fuels.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Fuelbeds</h2>
        <p>FCCS defines a fuelbed as the inherent physical characteristics of fuels that contribute to fire behavior and effects (Riccardi et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Riccardietal2007a">2007a</a>). A fuelbed can represent any scale that you consider to be mostly uniform. For example, a 10,000-acre western sagebrush ecosystem may be adequately represented by a single fuelbed, whereas a 100-acre Hawaiian rainforest may require several fuelbeds to capture the variability of fuel characteristics. </p>
        <p>Because FCCS fuelbeds are not scale dependent, they are easily mapped, and calculated results can readily be incorporated into geospatial analyses. </p>
        <p>FCCS describes fuelbeds in six strata: canopy, shrubs, nonwoody fuels, woody fuels, litter-lichen-moss, and ground fuels. Each stratum is further divided into one or more categories and subcategories to represent the complexity of wildland and managed fuels.</p>
        <h2>Fuel&#160;Characteristics</h2>
        <p>FCCS calculates <a href="FERA-FCCS-FC-Intro.htm">fuel characteristics</a> for each fuelbed stratum, category, and subcategory, and provides outputs in printable reports. The characteristics include percentage cover, depth (ft or in), total fuel loading (tons/ac), live fuel loading (tons/ac), dead fuel loading (tons/ac), fuel area index, packing ratio, tree density(#/acre), tree height to live crown (ft), and tree diameter at breast height (dbh).   Carbon content by fuel stratum, category and subcategory  is provided in an additional report.</p>
        <h2>Fire Potentials</h2>
        <p>FCCS calculates FCCS <a href="FERA-FCCS-FP-Intro.htm">fire potentials</a>, including surface fire behavior potential, crown fire potential, and available fuel potential. The FCCS fire potentials are indexed values, scaled between 0 and 9 and are based on default environmental conditions. They provide a flexible means of expressing any fuelbed as a function of its potential to produce fire behavior or effects. The intent is to provide an approach to quantifying fuels that is easy to communicate among fuels specialists and across a diversity of fuel types.  For example, if a ponderosa pine fuelbed located in Idaho has the same fire potentials as a long-leaf pine fuelbed in Florida, then the manager can expect similar fire behavior and fuel consumption under the same environmental conditions.</p>
        <h2>Surface Fire Behavior</h2>
        <p>Using fuel characteristics and input environmental variables, FCCS calculates <a href="FERA-FCCS-SFB-SurfaceFireBehaviorOutput.htm">surface fire behavior outputs</a>, including reaction intensity (Btu/ft2/min), rate of spread (ft/min), and flame length (ft).</p>
