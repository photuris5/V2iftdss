        <p>The FCCS fire potentials are a set of relative values that rate the intrinsic properties of a wildland fuelbed, including that fuelbed's potential for surface fire behavior, crown fire behavior, and available fuel for consumption under a benchmark set of the following kinds of data:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>wind speed (4 mi/h),</li>
            <li>slope (0%), and</li>
            <li>fuel moisture conditions (90% foliar moisture of shrubs, 60% foliar moisture of herbaceous fuels, 6% 1-hr woody fuel moisture, 7% 10-hr woody fuel moisture, and 8% 100-hr woody fuel moisture).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="fire potentials:use of;fire potentials:fire behavior and hazards and;fire behavior:fire potentials and;fire hazards:fire potentials and" />The fire potentials are for use in mapping fire hazards, categorizing fuelbeds on the basis of predicted fire behavior, and communicating degree of fire hazard.  They can also be used in conjunction with known environmental conditions to predict fire behavior and effects (i.e., scaled downward to reflect fuel moisture conditions, or scaled upward to represent wind speed or slope).</p>
        <h2>Nine Fire Potentials</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="fuelbeds:fire potentials and;fire potentials:fuelbeds and" />FCCS calculates and reports nine FCCS fire potentials for each fuelbed based on benchmark dry fuel conditions (D2L2 dry scenario: 90% foliar moisture of shrubs, 60% foliar moisture of nonwoody fuels, 6% fuel moisture of 1-hr, 7% fuel moisture of 10-hr, and 8% fuel moisture of 100-hr woody fuels). These nine FCCS fire potentials are arranged into three summary FCCS fire potentials:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li><a href="FERA-FCCS-FP-AvailableFuelPot.htm">available fuel  potential</a>, which includes flame available fuel, smoldering available fuel, and residual available fuel potentials</li>
            <li><a href="FERA-FCCS-FP-CrownFirePot.htm">crown fire  potential</a>, which includes crown fire initiation, crown to crown transmissivity, and crow fire rate of spread potentials</li>
            <li><a href="FERA-FCCS-SFB-Intro.htm">surface fire behavior potential</a>, which includes reaction, spread, and flame length potentials</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The following illustration shows the groupings for each of the summary groups; details for all of these are provided on the individual pages for each summary group.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Indices from the three summary groups (surface fire behavior potential, crown fire potential, and available fuel potential) are put together as a number; for example, 463 means</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>moderate surface fire (9.8-ft flames, 13.6 ft/min rate of spread),</li>
            <li>above-average crowning potential (6 on a scale of 9), and</li>
            <li>below-average available fuel (30 tons/acre).</li>
        </ul>
