        <h1>Natural Fuel Consumption Equations</h1>
        <p>In the early 1990s, FERA began development of new consumption algorithms based on recent research on the flaming and smoldering combustion phases in various natural fuelbed types in the United States.  The Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) fuelbed input design was incorporated into Consume 3.0 (as well as Consume 4.1) to make use of the national fuelbed database of fuelbed loadings.</p>
        <p> FCCS contains a fuelbed reference library and calculates a wide range of fuel characteristics. Fuel loading values can be either imported from FCCS or directly input by Consume users.  In both software applications, fuelbeds are organized into six strata, including canopy; shrubs; herbaceous vegetation; downed wood; litter-lichen-moss; and ground fuels, including duff.  Many fuelbeds do not contain every stratum and category.  For example, a grassland fuelbed comprises nonwoody vegetation, but may not contain canopy and shrub information.</p>
