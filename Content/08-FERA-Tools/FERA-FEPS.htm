            <MadCap:keyword term="FEPS (Fire Emission Production Simulator)" />Fire Emission Production Simulator (FEPS)</h1>
        <p>The Fire Emission Production Simulator (FEPS) predicts hourly consumption, emissions, and heat release of wildland fires.  Total consumption values from Consume or IFT-FOFEM are distributed over the life of the burn to generate hourly emission and release information. FEPS can be used for most forest, shrub and grassland types in North America.</p>
        <p>Originally developed as a revision to the Emission Production Model (EPM), FEPS version 1.0 was renamed due to extensive changes in data requirements and algorithms.  EPM was a Fortran-based model that predicted emission source strength for prescribed burning (Sandberg and Peterson, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#SandbergandPeterson1984">1984</a>).</p>
        <p>FEPS was recently recoded to work as a calculator module within the BlueSky modeling framework (<a href="http://playground.firesmoke.us/">http://playground.firesmoke.us</a>) and IFTDSS.  FEPS is used extensively in the southeastern United States to generate intermediate values used in VSmoke plume predictions (<a href="http://webcam.srs.fs.fed.us/tools/vsmoke">http://webcam.srs.fs.fed.us/tools/vsmoke</a>).</p>
