        <h1>Natural Fuels</h1>
        <p>The Consume natural fuel consumption models were developed from surface fire consumption studies in wildland fuels with little to no recent logging activity. </p>
        <p>With the exception of live vegetation, the <a href="FERA-Consume-NaturalEquations.htm">natural fuel consumption equations</a> are based on three regional fuel consumption studies that were funded in part by the Joint Fire Science Program. The three regional fuel consumption studies were of southern pines, western ponderosa pine, and boreal forests.</p>
        <p>Depending on the equation, Consume calculates fuel consumption at the stratum level, category level, or subcategory level, then summarizes consumption by stratum and fuelbed. </p>
        <p>Because so little is known about canopy consumption, Consume requires users to input estimated percentage canopy consumed. </p>
        <p>Shrub consumption equations were developed from prescribed burn studies in sagebrush and bitterbrush assemblages and are applied to both natural and activity fuel types.</p>
