            <MadCap:keyword term="surface fire behavior (FCCS):overview" />FCCS&#160;Surface Fire Behavior</h1>
        <p>FCCS predicts surface fire behavior based on input fuel characteristics and environmental variables, including midflame wind speed (mph), slope gradient (%) and moisture scenario (see <MadCap:xref href="FERA-FCCS-SFB-InputVariables.htm"><b>Input Variables Important to Surface Fire Behavior</b></MadCap:xref>).</p>
        <p>Surface fire behavior outputs include reaction intensity (Btu ft-2 min-1), rate of spread (ft/min), and flame length (ft). It also calculates crosswalks to one of the 13 original fire behavior prediction system fuel models (Anderson, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Anderson1982">1982</a>) and one of the 40 additional standard fuel models (Scott and Burgan, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#ScottandBurgen2005">2005</a>) based on calculated rate of spread and flame length.  (For a description of each of these  models, see <MadCap:xref href="../10-Reference/RefFuelModels.htm"><b>Fire Behavior Fuel Models and Their Environments</b></MadCap:xref>.)</p>
        <p>As a part of the fire behavior fuel model crosswalk, this module outputs the percentage of the flame length and rate of spread predicted by the 13 fire behavior fuel models and the 40 standard fuel models.</p>
