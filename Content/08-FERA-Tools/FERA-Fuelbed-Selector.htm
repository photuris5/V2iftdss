        <p>Fuelbed data sets can be used in runs that use fuelbed information (FCCS, Consume, and FEPS). Using the options in the <b>Select FCCS&#160;Fuelbeds</b> window, you can create one or more data sets.</p>
        <p><b style="font-style: italic;">To create a fuelbed data set,</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Access the <b>Data Tab</b>, then access the <b>Fuelbed Data</b> tab. </li>
            <li>Choose <b>Create a Data Set of FCCS Fuelbeds</b>. This opens the <b>Select FCCS&#160;Fuelbeds</b> window, which has a number of options. In this window, you can select a fuelbed data set from the list of all available FCCS fuelbeds, or you can narrow the data sets first, then select from the remaining options.</li>
            <li>If you wish to narrow your data set, under <b>Select FCCS&#160;Fuelbeds</b>, select an <a href="FERA-Fuelbed-Eco.htm">ecoregion</a> from the <b>Ecoregion</b> drop-down list. If you choose anything other than <b>Any Ecoregion</b>, the list of available fuelbeds in the <b>FCCS&#160;Fuelbeds</b> section changes so that it only includes fuelbeds from the selected region.</li>
            <li>You can then consecutively select a <a href="FERA-Fuelbed-Veg.htm">vegetation form</a>, a <a href="FERA-Fuelbed-Cover.htm">cover type</a>, a <a href="FERA-Fuelbed-Struct.htm">forest structural class</a>, and a <a href="FERA-FCCS-ChangeAgentsTable.htm">change agent</a>.  Each subsequent selection narrows the selection list further.  Note that if you are trying to narrow the list to single fuelbed, you might not need to select from every selection box.</li>
            <li>Under <b>FCCS Fuelbeds</b>, select one or more fuelbeds.</li>
            <li>After making your selections, you can create one or more fuelbed data sets. You can create a single fuelbed data set from one or more selected fuelbeds, or you can create single fuelbed data sets with one or more fuelbeds.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you would like to create a single fuelbed data set with one or more fuelbeds, name your data set, then choose <b>Create Data Set</b>.  </li>
                <li>If you would like to create individual fuelbed data sets from one or more selected fuelbeds, you have the option of naming your data sets (<i>name of data set_fuelbed number</i>). For example, if you assigned the name conifer to the data set, and you had selected fueldbeds 181 and 208, then IFTDSS creates two data sets named as follows: <i>conifer_181</i> and <i>conifer_208</i>. Or you can leave the data set name blank, and IFTDSS will assign a fuelbed file name to each data set (<i>FB_0181_FCCS.xml</i>, <i>FB_0208_FCCS.xml</i>). After either naming or not, choose <b>Create Separate Data Sets</b>. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Your data set will be created, and you are returned to the <b>Fuelbed Data</b> tab.</li>
        </ol>
