        <p>Characterizing fuels and assessing their fire hazard has always been important to fire and fuel managers. These topics are becoming increasingly pertinent to other specialists, including ecologists, air quality and smoke managers, land use planners, global change scientists and carbon modelers. With its large fuels data set and ability to represent a wide variety of fuel conditions, FCCS has numerous applications, from small-scale fuel reduction projects to large-scale emissions and carbon assessments.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>If you are working on a fire hazard reduction project, you may wish to use FCCS to <a href="FERA-Fuelbed-Selector.htm">select</a> or <a href="FERA-Fuelbed-Editor.htm">build</a> fuelbeds that represent pre- and post-burn fuel conditions. The FCCS calculator summarizes fuel characteristics for each fuelbed you analyze and ranks its <a href="FERA-FCCS-FP-SurfaceFirePotential.htm">surface fire</a>, <a href="FERA-FCCS-FP-CrownFirePot.htm">crown fire</a>, and <a href="FERA-FCCS-FP-AvailableFuelPot.htm">available</a> fuel potentials. It also provides predicted surface fire rates of spread and flame lengths based on input environmental conditions.</li>
            <li>FCCS can be used as a planning tool to target which fuels should be removed to effectively reduce the on-site fire hazard. It can also be used as a reporting tool to summarize pre- and post-burn fuel characteristics and fire hazard potential.</li>
            <li>Air quality specialists can run FCCS to calculate fuel loading to be used as inputs to emissions and smoke production software packages such as <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/fera/products/consume.html">Consume</a> or <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/airfire/">BlueSky</a>.</li>
            <li>Landscape ecologists can assign fuelbeds to the landscape and can display and analyze FCCS outputs such as <a href="FERA-FCCS-FC-FuelLoading.htm">fuel loading</a>, predicted <a href="FERA-FCCS-SFB-Intro.htm">surface fire behavior</a>, <a href="FERA-FCCS-FC-TotalCarbon.htm">carbon stores</a>, and FCCS <a href="FERA-FCCS-FP-Intro.htm">fire potentials</a>.</li>
        </ul>
