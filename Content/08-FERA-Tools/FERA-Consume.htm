        <p>Land managers apply prescribed fire and manage wildfires to maintain and restore ecosystems, reduce fuel loadings, expose mineral soil, improve wildlife habitat, and reduce the hazard of wildfire.  In the past, a fire that consumed most of the downed wood and organic material on a site was thought to have met management objectives.  As understanding of forest ecosystems has increased, forest managers have become more discriminating in their use of prescribed fire and managed wildfires.  Fires are now applied to satisfy forestry management objectives and benefit forest ecosystems as a whole.</p>
        <p>Consume is a decision-making tool designed to assist planning for prescribed burns and wildfires using realistic fuels data.  Consume predicts fuel consumption, pollutant emissions, and heat release based on input fuel characteristics, lighting patterns, fuel moistures and other environmental variables.</p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Fuel consumption is an important variable in fire effects modeling.  An understanding of fuel consumption is needed to assess when and how fire should be applied to meet site and landscape objectives and also reduce air quality impacts. </p>
        <p>Because Consume captures the inherent complexity of wildland fuels through a close interface with the Fuel Characteristics Classification System, specific fuel strata and/categories can be targeted for prescription, or noted as a potential source of pollutant emissions, depending on the burn scenario. </p>
        <p>For example, a fuelbed with a developed organic soil layer (termed "duff" in Consume) may create a significant emissions source if burned under low duff moisture conditions.  By evaluating a range of potential burn scenarios, resource managers can target a suitable prescription window and determine when and where to conduct a prescribed burn or plan for a wildland fire to achieve desired objectives, while reducing the effect on other resources.</p>
        <p> Consume is applicable to most wildland fires in forests, shrubs, woodlands, and grasslands in North America. Consume includes separate equations for calculating consumption of <a href="FERA-Consume-Activity.htm">activity</a> and <a href="FERA-Consume-NaturalFuelsIntro.htm">natural</a> fuels.</p>
        <p>The Pacific Northwest Research Station (Sandberg, 1980; Sandberg and Ottmar, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#SandbergandOttmar1983">1983</a>; Ottmar et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Ottmaretal1993">1993</a>), Missoula Fire Lab (Brown et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Brownetal1991">1991</a>; Reinhardt et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Reinhardtetal1997">1997</a>; Albini and Reinhardt, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#AlbiniandReinhardt1997">1997</a>), and the Pacific Southwest Station have been leaders in the development of both theoretical and empirical fuel consumption models. Through that effort, we have a wealth of fuel consumption predictive algorithms for various fuel bed components and combustion phases for prescribed burning in Douglas-fir/western hemlock, west coast hardwoods, and logging slash. These efforts have led to several software programs currently being used by resource managers, including Consume (Ottmar et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Ottmaretal1993">1993</a>; Ottmar, 1998); FOFEM 4.0 (Reinhardt et al., <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Reinhardtetal1997">1997</a>), and a modified theoretical/empirical model called Burnout (Albini and Reinhardt, <a href="../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#AlbiniandReinhardt1997">1997</a>).</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Consume (FFA tool):history" />Development History</h2>
        <p>In the early 1980s, the Fire and Environmental Resource Application Group (FERA) of the Pacific Northwest Research Station began to develop fuel consumption models and emission factors for prescribed burning planning in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
        <p>Consume 1.0 included a set of consumption algorithms formulated from data collected at operational broadcast burns in logging slash. As new fuel consumption equations were formulated, Consume 2.1 was developed with algorithms for activity-piled, activity-non-piled, and natural fuels; and emission factors, making it possible to estimate emissions.</p>
        <p>In 2002, FERA received funding from the Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) to enhance Consume by adding the ability to predict fuel consumption and smoke emissions in wildland fuelbeds (e.g., burn units without recent logging slash).</p>
        <p>Consume 3.0 included new consumption algorithms based on recent research on the flaming and smoldering combustion phases in forests and shrublands without recent logging activity in the United States.</p>
        <p>During the 1990s, FERA began developing models of fuel consumption by combustion stage for other fuel types beyond the Pacific Northwest and different configurations of fuels.</p>
        <p>In addition, FERA began developing a new system to characterize fuels called the Fuel Characteristic System. WIth this system, managers could select different fuel loadings for input into Consume. The Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) fuelbed input design was incorporated into Consume 3.0 to make use of the national fuelbed database of fuelbed loadings.</p>
        <p>Most recently, Consume was re-coded using Python (Consume 4.1) to be a calculation module within the Fire and Fuels Application, IFTDSS, and other applications,  including <a href="http://playground.firesmoke.us/">BlueSky</a> and the <a href="http://wfeis.mtri.org/">Wildland Fire Emissions Inventory System</a>.</p>
