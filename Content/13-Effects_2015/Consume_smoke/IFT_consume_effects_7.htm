            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="">Use the <b>Add data</b> tool (circled in red)</MadCap:conditionalText>  to find the folder with the exported Consume inputs and outputs. For this example we will download the <b>FB (Fuelbed) layer</b> from inputs. From outputs we’ll download consumption layers for <b>duff, litter, woody fuel, sound woody fuel, rotten woody fuel, and canopy</b>, as well as the <b>total particulate matter</b> layer. This process is displayed in the images below:</p>

However, if you have a corresponding database file of FCCS fuelbeds in your area, their numbers, and names, it can be joined to the IFTDSS fuelbed layer and exported as new layer; this will allow you to identify fuelbeds by name across your landscape.</p>

        <p>Specify which fields to join, in the example below the <strong class="Strong">VALUE</strong> field of the imported IFTDSS fuelbed layer corresponds to the FCCS number (Field 3) of an FCCS text file that was available for the area in this example. If you are using a table that has more FCCS fuelbeds than your imported IFTDSS fuelbeds layer, make sure to select the join option <strong class="Strong">Keep only matching matching records</strong> is selected. <strong class="Strong">Select OK</strong>.</p>

        <p>To make the join permanent, export the joined fuelbed layer by <strong class="Strong">right clicking</strong>, select <strong class="Strong">data</strong>, and <strong class="Strong">export data.</strong> Ensure your extent and spatial references are set to use the original (<b>Raster Dataset (Original)</b>), and <b>Cell Size</b> is 30 by 30, and the format is set to GRID, as they are in the figure below.

        <p>For this example, we have joined the fuelbed names to the FB data layer, and exported the result as new raster file so that fuelbed names are visible on the landscape.</p>
        <h2>Changing the appearance of a layer</h2>
        <p>Right click on each layer, select <b>properties&gt;symbology</b>, and adjust the color and display to your preference. In this example we selected the total particulate layer, and selected <b>stretched</b> and chose a color scheme ranging from green to red as the values increased. This will show where on the landscape the highest particulate matter concentrations would be produced. </p>

        <h2>Comparing layers</h2>
        <p>By toggling back and forth between the fuelbed layer and the particulate matter layer, and using the point info tool. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.Removed"><b>identify tool</b> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.Removed">(circled in red) </MadCap:conditionalText></MadCap:conditionalText>we can see the fuels which are likely to produce the greatest quantities of particulate matter, that could potentially impact human health, or regulatory compliance.</p>

        <p>We can see in the mountains to the north of the valley, the fuelbeds and high particulate matter areas match well. Using the identify tool, we can see that the fuelbed predicted to generate these levels of particulate matter is Fuelbed 2, ‘Douglas fir-Western redcedar-Western Hemlock’.</p>
        <p>By using the same sliding color scale to see the relative highest amounts of various fuels, we see Fuelbed 2 also corresponds well to high quantities of litter, duff, and sound woody fuel consumed, but not necessarily fine woody fuel consumption. This provides information on the specific fuels in these areas that would contribute to particulate emissions, and may be candidates for treatments.</p>

        </p>
        <p>These choices are just examples, feel free to explore, using a similar approach for your own area of interest, evaluating different fuels, fuelbeds, and emissions. Doing so will allow you to identify areas of interest, and potential fuel characteristics.</p>
        <p>To use this feature to compare emissions from pre and post-treatments, go through the process outlined in this tutorial using your pre-treatment data. When finished, save your outputs ...... Then create a new run using post-treatment data and compare the outputs.</p>

        </p>
        <p>This comparison can be useful in both identifying areas of the landscape that are likely to produce high levels of emissions, and the differences in emissions between treated and untreated areas.</p>
