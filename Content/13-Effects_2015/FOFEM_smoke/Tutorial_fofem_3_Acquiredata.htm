        <p>Next, you will be prompted to choose an <b>FCCS Digital Photo Series (DPS)</b> from which fuel loading will be drawn. If you have your own data, you may leave these blank and continue with the workflow, populating the fuel loadings without the DPS. For this example we will select a DPS.  </p>
        <p>First, click on the <b>FCCS Digital Photo Series</b> option (circled in red) to see which DPS are available</p>

        </p>
        <p>This will take you to a new page in your browser - the <b>Digital Photo Series</b> home page. Here, you may search for a specific site or browse for your site to obtain fuel loading data. You may also click on the sites indicated on the map. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Selecting <b>Site Search</b> brings up a national map with fuels sampling sites. For this example we will select the closest point to our stand (circled in red). Once a point is clicked upon, corresponding sites will appear at the bottom of the page.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Clicking on the image of the site brings up the DPS number (circled in red), site information and fuel loading details.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Review the image, site information, and fuel loading data for your chosen site. If it matches your stand, note the <b>DPS number</b> and return to the IFTDSS Digital Photo Series page. In this example we will use the DPS <b>SONH 6</b>, a site dominated by Douglas fir, hemlock, and cedar.</p>
        <p>Select the IFTDSS Digital Photo Series number from the dropdown menu for IFTDSS simulation 1. We will leave simulation 2 blank and input the changes in fuel loading manually in the next step. You may close the browser window containing the DPS website, it will no longer be needed. Select <strong class="Strong">Next</strong> at the bottom of the page.</p>
