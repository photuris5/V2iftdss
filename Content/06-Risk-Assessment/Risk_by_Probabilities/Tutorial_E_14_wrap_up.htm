        <h1>Next Steps:&#160; Assessing Further Needs</h1>
        <p>The information from this risk assessment can be used with other ecological and natural resource planning information to rapidly assess areas within the landscape that may warrant fuels treatment.</p>
        <p>After reviewing the aerial photography and the fire behavior fuel model layer, it is clear that the LANDFIRE data needs to be edited; return to the editing spatial landscape data step to edit your fuel models.&#160; Then rerun the module to see differences in the fire behavior and risk outputs.</p>

        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>Using the risk assessment workflow in IFTDSS, we were able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Acquire LANDFIRE data and set up a project in IFTDSS.</li>
            <li>Create a run focused on fire risk across a landscape (using IFT-RANDIG).</li>
            <li>Develop a values-at-risk map.</li>
            <li>Establish environmental parameters.</li>
            <li>Review/edit spatial landscape input data.</li>
            <li>Analyze potential fire behavior output data.</li>
            <li>Identify potential fire hazards and risks across a landscape.</li>
            <li>Examine data relative to points of interest and other geographic features using Google Earth.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This concludes the tutorial on creating a risk assessment using the flame length probabilities approach.</p>
        <h2>Additional Help</h2>
        <p>To navigate to additional tutorials in the IFTDSS online help content,</p>
        <p class="p_2">1. Click the <strong class="Strong">Help</strong> button.</p>
        <p class="p_2">2. Then select <strong class="Strong">Getting Started (Tutorials and Videos) </strong>from the side menu.</p>
        <p>On that page, you’ll find links to tutorials and videos on such topics as hazard analysis, prescribed burn planning, fuels treatment, spatial analysis across a landscape, and many more.</p>
