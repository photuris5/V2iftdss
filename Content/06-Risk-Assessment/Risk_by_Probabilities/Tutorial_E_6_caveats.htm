        <h1>Analysis Considerations: Things You Need to Know</h1>
        <p>When reviewing and analyzing data, consider the following points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The LANDFIRE data resolution is 30 x 30 m spatial resolution, which affects data interpretation.</li>
            <li>The flame lengths probabilities approach assumes random ignitions across the area of interest; however, some areas have higher ignition potentials than others. This approach does not take this into account.</li>
            <li>For example, human-caused ignitions often occur close to roads and houses, and natural ignitions caused by lightning occur at elevated areas. </li>
        </ul>
