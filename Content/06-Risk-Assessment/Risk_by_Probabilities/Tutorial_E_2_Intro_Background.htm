        <h1>Introduction &amp; Background</h1>
        <p>IFTDSS provides two approaches for assessing fire hazard and risk across the landscape based on the methods described in RMRS-GTR-235 <span class="span_2">Wildfire Risk and Hazard: Procedures for the First Approximation</span> (Calkin et al. 2010a):</p>
        <p>1. Worst-Case Flame Lengths Approach (see <MadCap:xref href="../Risk_by_FlameLength/Tutorial_D_1_Creating_Risk_Asmt_WCFL.htm"><b>Tutorial D</b></MadCap:xref>)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This approach is useful when the user is interested in identifying high fire hazard situations during <strong class="Strong">wind-driven wildfires.</strong>In the future, this tool will be useful for assessing the effectiveness of a fuel treatment at reducing the hazard of a fire burning as a head fire.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Flame Length Probabilities Approach</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This approach differs from the worst-case flame length approach in that it considers the likelihood of a fire burning as a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire given a random ignition in the landscape when determining the potential losses or benefits for an area represented by a pixel burning. This approach is useful when the user is interested in identifying the potential consequences of an area represented by a pixel burning <strong class="Strong">under variable fire conditions</strong> and/or assessing the potential ecological benefits of using fire as a management tool.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The processes employed in IFTDSS uses a quantitative risk framework to approximate the expected loss and/or potential ecological benefits to valued resources (values at risk) from wildfire. In the risk assessment, burn probabilities and fire behavior potentials are estimated using the fire simulation modules <MadCap:xref href="../../10-Reference/RefFlamMap.htm"><b>IFT-FlamMap</b></MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../10-Reference/RefRAN.htm"><b>IFT-RANDIG)</b></MadCap:xref>. The modeled output is coupled with data on human and ecological values at risk using a set of fire-effects response functions, with the goal of estimating the expected loss or potential benefit resulting from fire.&#160; </p>
        <p>In this tutorial, we focus on the <b>flame length probabilities approach</b>. This method uses the response functions developed by Calkin et al. (2010a) and modeled flame length burn probabilities from the IFT-RANDIG burn probability simulator to estimate the likelihood of the area represented by the pixel burning, and the potential consequences if the area represented by the pixel is burned by a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire. We’ll spatially identify areas surrounding the Olompali State Historic Park (located near Novato, California) where fire is likely to occur, and view potential losses/benefits from a burn based on set environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>This type of risk assessment should be used as a first approximation of how fire likelihood and fire behavior potentials across landscapes influence fire hazard and risk to social, economic, and ecological values within an area of interest. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The results can provide information useful for evaluating and prioritizing where to place treatments to reduce fire hazard and risk to valued resources.</p>
