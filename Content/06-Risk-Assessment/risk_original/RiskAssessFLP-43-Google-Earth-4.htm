            <MadCap:keyword term="flame length probabilities:Google Earth and;Google Earth:worst-case flame length example" />Step 9c: Focus on Highest Risk Areas</h1>
        <p>In this example (still in Google Earth), we focus on one of our highest risk areas, the wildland-urban interface.  It is important to review a number of different fire behavior descriptor variables, such as burn probability at medium flame lengths and overall burn probability. In this example, we are using the risk assessment output layers.</p>
        <p>First, take a look at relative net value change.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Next, take a look at the map for burn probability at medium flame lengths (4 to 8 ft) . Here we can see that the burn probability at medium flame lengths ranges from 0% to 44%.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Another view is of overall burn probability. In this example, for each pixel area, we see that the likelihood of burning with any flame length falls in a range from 0% to 44%.</p>
