        <p>In this example (still in Google Earth), we focus on one of our highest risk areas, the wildland-urban interface.  It is important to review a number of different fire behavior descriptor variables, such as flame length class and overall burn probability. In this example, we are using the risk assessment output layers.</p>
        <p>First, take a look at relative net value change.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Next, take a look at the map by flame length class. Here, we can see that the flame lengths are predicted to range from high (8 to 11 ft) to very high (&gt;11 ft) under the set environmental conditions.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Now take a look at overall burn probability. Here, for each pixel area, we see that the likelihood of burning falls in a range from 22% to 44%.</p>
