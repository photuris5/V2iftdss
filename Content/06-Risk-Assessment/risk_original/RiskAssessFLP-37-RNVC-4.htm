        <h1>Step 7c: Review Relative Net Value Change Data</h1>
        <p>Taking a simple first look at the default relative net value change parameter, we can see that a majority of the pixels classified in the “Greatest Loss/Least Benefit” category (pixels representing areas with the highest risk of loss based on the values at risk and the overall burn probability) are surrounding the wildland-urban interface and the airport (outlined in pink).</p>
        <p>In this example, we would like to refine the area of interest to find the areas within the wildland-urban interface and airport that have the greatest potential loss.</p>
