        <p>On this page is a link to a PDF of a detailed tutorial  on how to use IFTDSS  to create a risk assessment using the flame length probabilities approach. This approach differs from the <a href="RiskAssessWorstCaseTutorial.htm">worst-case flame length</a> approach in that it considers the likelihood of a fire burning as a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire given a random ignition in the landscape when determining the potential losses or benefits of an area represented by a pixel burning.  The flame length probabilities approach is useful when the user is interested in identifying the potential consequences of an area represented by a pixel burning under variable fire conditions and/or assessing the potential ecological benefits of using fire as a management tool.</p>
        <p>The objective of a landscape-level risk assessment is to approximate the expected loss and/or potential ecological benefits to valued resources  (values at risk) from wildfire. The results from the risk assessment tools in IFTDSS can provide information useful for evaluating and prioritizing where to place fuel  treatments to reduce fire hazard and risk to valued resources.</p>
        <p>In this tutorial, a risk assessment is performed surrounding the Olompali State Historic Park (SHP) located near Novato, California. The Olompali SHP was chosen for an example because the park</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>borders a major highway (Highway 101)</li>
            <li>is adjacent to an airport</li>
            <li>is located just north of a wildland urban interface (Novato, California)</li>
            <li>has  several historic buildings</li>
            <li>has numerous archeological sites</li>
        </ul>
