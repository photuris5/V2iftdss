        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../../Resources/Snippets/RAIntroduction.flsnp" />
        <p>On this page is a link to a PDF of a detailed tutorial  on how to use IFTDSS  to create a risk assessment using the worst-case flame lengths approach. This approach is useful when a conservative estimate of fire hazard and risk is appropriate or when you are interested in identifying high fire hazard situations during wind-driven wildfires. The most severe damages to values at risk occur when landscapes are burned under high-intensity, wind-driven head fire conditions.</p>
        <p>The objective of a landscape-level risk assessment is to approximate the expected loss and/or potential ecological benefits to valued resources  (values at risk) from wildfire. The results from the risk assessment tools in IFTDSS can provide information useful for evaluating and prioritizing where to place fuel  treatments to reduce fire hazard and risk to valued resources.</p>
        <p>In this tutorial, a risk assessment is performed surrounding the Olompali State Historic Park (SHP) located near Novato, California. The Olompali SHP was chosen for an example because the park</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>borders a major highway (Highway 101)</li>
            <li>is adjacent to an airport</li>
            <li>is located just north of a wildland-urban interface (Novato, California)</li>
            <li>has  several historic buildings</li>
            <li>has numerous archeological sites</li>
        </ul>
