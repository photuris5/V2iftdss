        <p>The LANDFIRE data resolution is 30 x 30 m spatial resolution, which affects data interpretation.</p>
        <p>The risk analysis by flame length probabilities approach assumes random ignitions across the area of interest; however, some areas have higher ignition potentials than others. This approach does not take this into account. For example, human-caused ignitions often occur close to roads and houses,  and natural ignitions caused by lightning occur at elevated areas.</p>
