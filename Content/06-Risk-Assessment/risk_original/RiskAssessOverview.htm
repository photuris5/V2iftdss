            <MadCap:keyword term="risk assessments:overview" />Overview and Objectives</h1>
        <p>There is no universally accepted framework for assessing the social, economic, and ecological risks resulting from fire in the landscape.  However, recent efforts have been made to develop a risk assessment process that can be used to provide information useful for prioritizing where fuels treatments and mitigation measures may be warranted to address fire hazard and risk.  IFTDSS provides two approaches for assessing fire hazard and risk across the landscape based on the methods described in the RMRS-GTR-235 <em>Wildfire Risk and Hazard: Procedures for the First Approximation</em> (Calkin et. al., <a href="../../10-Reference/Bibliography.htm#Calkinetal2010a">2010a</a>).</p>
        <p>The processes proposed by Calkin et al. (2010a) and modified for use in IFTDSS are designed to develop a strategic-level, first approximation of how fire likelihood and fire behavior potentials across landscapes influence risk to social, economic, and ecological values within an area of interest.</p>
        <p>The processes implemented in IFTDSS are based on a quantitative risk framework that approximates the expected loss and/or potential ecological benefits to valued resources (<a href="RiskAssessValuesatRisk.htm">values at risk</a>) from wildfire.  In this process, burn probabilities and fire behavior potentials are estimated using fire simulation modules. The modeled output is coupled with data on human and ecological values at risk using fire-effects response functions to estimate the expected loss or potential benefit resulting from fire.</p>
        <p>We choose the Calkin et al. (2010a) approach that incorporates risk assessment research by Mark Finney and Alan Ager for our first set of risk assessment modules for several reasons.  First, the Calkin et al. (2010a) approach uses the best developed quantitative procedures for assigning risk across landscapes in a fire management context.  Next, these procedures use tools and functionality currently implemented in the IFTDSS.  Finally, we felt that the Calkin et al. (2010a) approach provides easy-to-understand quantitative measures of the hazards of burning, while also including quantitative metrics for evaluating potential ecological benefits of fire on the landscape. Additional risk assessment strategies will be implemented as IFTDSS development continues.</p>
        <p>The results from the risk assessment tools in IFTDSS can provide information useful for evaluating and prioritizing where to place fuel treatments to reduce fire hazard and risk to valued resources.</p>
        <h2> <a name="RiskAssessMethods"></a><MadCap:keyword term="risk assessments:approaches" />Two Risk Assessment Methodologies</h2>
        <p>IFTDSS provides two approaches for assessing risk: risk assessment by worst-case flame length and risk assessment by burn probability.</p>
        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="worst-case flame length risk assessments:overview" />Risk Assessment by Worst-Case Flame Length</h3>
        <p>In this approach, risk is defined as the expected net value change within an area (in this case, an area represented by a 30 x 30 meter pixel) calculated as the product of (1) the probability that the area represented by the pixel will burn given a random ignition within the project area, and (2) the resulting change in financial or ecological value (response function) if the area represented by the pixel burns with a specific flame length. </p>
        <p>The most severe damages to values at risk occur when landscapes are burned under high-intensity, wind-driven head fire conditions.</p>
        <p>This method uses the response functions developed by Calkin et. al. (2010a), modeled flame lengths from the <a href="../../10-Reference/RefFlamMap.htm">FlamMap fire behavior module</a>, and burn probabilities from the <a href="../../10-Reference/RefRAN.htm">RANDIG burn probability simulator</a> to estimate the likelihood of the area represented by the pixel burning, and the potential consequences if the area represented by the pixel is burned by a head fire.</p>
        <p>This approach is referred to as the “worst case” estimation of fire risk because it is based on a single IFT-FlamMap run, where the areas represented by every pixel are all always assumed to burn under the worst case (i.e., by a head fire).  However, for this approach, the IFT-FlamMap-RANDIG burn probability simulator provides information as to whether the area represented by a pixel will burn regardless of flame length; that is, the area represented by a pixel can be burned as a backing fire, flanking fire, or head fire in the IFT-FlamMap-RANDIG simulations. This approach may overestimate the degree of damage to the value at risk in an area represented by an individual pixel.</p>

        <h3>
            <MadCap:keyword term="flame length probabilities:overview;flame lengths:risk assessments" />Risk Assessment by Flame Length Probabilities</h3>
        <p>In this approach, risk is defined as the expected net value change within an area (in this case, an area represented by a 30 x 30 meter pixel) calculated as the product of (1) the probabilities that the area represented by the pixel will burn (using user-defined flame lengths and flame length classes—low, medium, high, and very high) given a random ignition within the project area, and (2) the resulting change in financial or ecological value (response function) if the area represented by the pixel burns for each user-defined flame length class.</p>
        <p>This method uses the response functions developed by Calkin et. al. (2010a) and modeled flame length burn probabilities from the <a href="../../10-Reference/RefRAN.htm">IFT-FlamMap-RANDIG burn probability simulator</a> to estimate the likelihood of the area represented by the pixel burning, and the potential consequences if the area represented by the pixel is burned by a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire.</p>
        <p>This approach differs from the worst-case flame length approach in that it considers the likelihood of a fire burning as a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire given a random ignition in the landscape when determining the potential losses or benefits for an area represented by a pixel burning.</p>
