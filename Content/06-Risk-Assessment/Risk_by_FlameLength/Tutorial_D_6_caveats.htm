        <h1>Analysis Considerations: Things You Need to Know</h1>
        <p>When analyzing and reviewing data in this tutorial, and working on your own areas of interest, consider the following points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fire behavior values are calculated pixel-by-pixel and are <strong class="Strong">simulated independently</strong> with respect to the surrounding pixels in the landscape input file.</li>
            <li>For the IFT-FlamMap output, fire behavior in adjacent locations, roads, or hazardous fuel types in proximity to the area under assessment <strong class="Strong">does not</strong> affect the fire behavior potential of the pixel (or point location) being assessed.</li>
            <li>The LANDFIRE data resolution is 30 x 30 m spatial resolution, which affects data interpretation.</li>
            <li>The worst-case flame lengths approach assumes random ignitions across the area of interest; however, some areas have higher ignition potentials than others.&#160; This approach does not yet take this into account. For example, human-caused ignitions often occur close to roads and natural ignitions caused by lightning occur at elevated areas.&#160; </li>
            <li>The worst-case flame lengths risk assessment approach may overestimate the degree of damage to the value at risk in an area represented by an individual pixel.</li>
        </ul>
