        <p>IFTDSS provides two approaches for assessing fire hazard and risk across the landscape based on the methods described in RMRS-GTR-235 <span class="span_2">Wildfire Risk and Hazard: Procedures for the First Approximation</span> (Calkin et. al., 2010a):</p>
        <p>1. Worst-Case Flame Lengths Approach</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This approach is useful when the user is interested in identifying high fire hazard situations during <strong class="Strong">wind-driven wildfires.</strong></li>
            <li>In the future, this tool will be useful for assessing the effectiveness of a fuel treatment at reducing the hazard of a fire burning as a head fire.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Flame Length Probabilities Approach (see <MadCap:xref href="../Risk_by_Probabilities/Tutorial_E_1_Risk_Asmt_probability.htm"><b>Tutorial E</b></MadCap:xref>)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>This approach differs from the worst-case flame length approach in that it considers the likelihood of a fire burning as a backing fire, a flanking fire, or a head fire given a random ignition in the landscape when determining the potential losses or benefits for an area represented by a pixel burning.</li>
            <li>This approach is useful when the user is interested in identifying the potential consequences of an area represented by a pixel burning <b>under variable fire conditions</b> and/or assessing the potential ecological benefits of using fire as a management tool.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The processes employed in IFTDSS uses a quantitative risk framework to approximate the expected loss and/or potential ecological benefits to valued resources (values at risk) from wildfire. In the risk assessment, burn probabilities and fire behavior potentials are estimated using the fire simulation modules<MadCap:xref href="../../10-Reference/RefFlamMap.htm"><b>(IFT-FlamMap)</b></MadCap:xref> and <MadCap:xref href="../../10-Reference/RefRAN.htm"><b>(IFT-RANDIG)</b></MadCap:xref>. The modeled output is coupled with data on human and ecological values at risk using a set of fire-effects response functions, with the goal of estimating the expected loss or potential benefit resulting from fire.&#160; </p>
        <p>In this tutorial, we focus on the <strong class="Strong">worst-case flame lengths approach.</strong> This approach is referred to as the “worst case” estimation of fire risk because the flame length simulation is based on a single IFT-FlamMap run, where each pixel within the run areas is assumed to burn under the worst case conditions (i.e., by a head fire with the highest potential flame lengths). We’ll spatially identify areas surrounding the Olompali State Historic Park (located near Novato, California) where fire is likely to occur, and view potential losses/benefits from a burn based on set environmental conditions. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>This type of risk assessment should be used as a first approximation of how fire likelihood and fire behavior potentials across landscapes influence fire hazard and risk to social, economic, and ecological values within an area of interest. </li>
            <li>The results can provide information useful for evaluating and prioritizing where to place treatments to reduce fire hazard and risk to valued resources.</li>
        </ul>
