        <h2 class="Heading2">Identifying Potential Fire Hazards and Risk</h2>
        <p>While still in Google Earth, using information derived from the modeled fire behavior, as well as the spatial landscape data, you can identify potential fire hazard and risk areas surrounding the Olompali State Historic Park (see outlined areas).</p>
        <p>In this example, we selected the custom relative net value change distribution to view highest risk areas across our area of interest (outlined in blue).</p>
        <p>Next, we’ll take a more in-depth look at the wildland-urban interface (identified by bullseye)</p>
        <p class="p_4">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_D_WCFL_2015/2_0_Tutorial_D_cap_37.png" class="img_2" style="width: 515px; height: 429px;" alt="Olompali state park in the north and the wildland urban interface in the south are both covered in red pixels indicating areas of greatest loss. We will take a more detailed look at an area within the wildland urban interface indicated by a bullseye." />
        </p>
        <p>View the <b>Relative Net Value Change</b> layer to see what valuable resources are of most concern across your area of interest.</p>
        <p>In this example (still in Google Earth), we focus in on one of our highest risk areas, the wildland-urban interface.&#160; It is important to review a number of different fire behavior descriptor variables, such as flame length class and overall burn probability.</p>
        <p>Here, we can see an area of relatively high loss (right), next to an areas of lesser loss (left).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_D_WCFL_2015/2_0_Tutorial_D_cap_38.png" class="img_2" style="width: 635px; height: 442px;" alt="Relative net value change. Areas of wildland urban interface are classified as areas of greatest loss while wildland areas are classified as less loss." />
        </p>
        <p>By evaluating the predicted flame lengths, we can see that much of the area is predicted to experience high (8 to 11 ft) to very high (&gt;11 ft) flame lengths under our specified set of environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_D_WCFL_2015/2_0_Tutorial_D_cap_39.png" class="img_2" style="width: 616px; height: 429px;" alt="This area is predicted to experience high (8 to 11 ft) to very high (&amp;gt;11 ft) flame lengths under our specified set of environmental conditions." />
        </p>
        <p>Looking at the probability layer, we can see the likelihood of burning in the high loss wildland urban interface approximately ranges from 15-25%.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_D_WCFL_2015/2_0_Tutorial_D_cap_40.png" class="img_2" style="width: 594px; height: 414px;" alt="The likelihood of burning in the high loss wildland urban interface approximately ranges from 15-25%." />
        </p>
        <p>This example uses the risk assessment output layers.</p>
        <p>This area is at risk for high potential loss from fire.&#160; Under the red flag warning conditions, which predicted high to very high flame lengths, the likelihood this area will ignite is moderate.&#160; </p>
        <p>Remember that it is also important to <b>review the landscape data in your area of interest</b> alongside Fire Behavior, Burn Probability, and Net Value Change outputs.  This location is dominated by flashy fuels;  Fuel Model 4: chaparral (indicated in brown) and Fuel Model 1 and 2: grass models (indicated in yellow and blue). The wildland-urban interface has moderate, south- to southwest-facing slopes.  </p>
        <p>In summary, using the risk assessment input and output layers, it appears that this area is at risk for high potential loss from fire.  Under the red flag warning conditions, which predicted high to very high flame lengths, the likelihood this area will ignite is moderate.  Thus, after reviewing the modeled fire behavior, fire risk, and spatial landscape data, further analysis and site visits and/or fuels treatments may be required.</p>
