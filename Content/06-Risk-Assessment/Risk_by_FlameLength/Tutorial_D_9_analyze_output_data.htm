        <p>After the IFT-FlamMap and IFT-RANDIG modules finish running, you can review your fire behavior output variables using the map.</p>
        <p>The fire behavior output variables include:</p>

In the next sections we'll use a real example to show how net value change is calculated. </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Relative-Net-Change"></a>About Relative Net Value Change</h2>
        <p>Risk is defined as the expected net value change per pixel calculated as the product of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The probability that the area represented by the pixel burns given a random ignition within the project area, and </li>
            <li>The resulting change in financial or ecological value (response function) if the area represented by the pixel burns with a specific flame length for a single static IFT-FlamMap run. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the risk model runs, a <strong class="Strong">Relative Net Value Change</strong> map is generated. In this section we will:</p>

            </img>
        </p>
        <p>In this example, the pixel selected was assigned a Response Function 4, and the pixel was predicted to have burned with a “High” flame length (8 to 11 ft); therefore the pixel is assigned a Net Value Change (NVC) multiplier of -10, based on the table.</p>
        <p>The overall burn probability for the grid cell is 0.2250, so the burn probability of 0.2250 is multiplied by the NVC multiplier of -10 to obtain a net value change value of -2.25.</p>

        <p>Next, we discuss how the default relative net value change is binned into the five data subsets (listed in the Relative Net Value Change legend).</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="Classifying-RNVC"></a>Classifying Relative Net Value Change Data</h2>
        <p>The relative net value change parameter is classified into five data subsets. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Greatest Loss/Least Benefit</li>
            <li>High Loss/Low Benefit</li>
            <li>Average Loss/Benefit</li>
            <li>Low Loss/High Benefit</li>
            <li>Least Loss/Greatest Benefit</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For the default relative net value change parameter, <strong class="Strong">the output value range is binned by 20%</strong> for all of the categories.</p>
        <p>For example, if your data ranges from a numerical value of -20 to +40, the data subsets will be binned into the following data ranges:&#160; -20 to -8, -8 to 4, 4 to 16, 16 to 28, and 28 to 40.</p>
        <p>Using the example grid cell from the previous step, the relative net value change number (-2.25) for that specific grid cell was binned into the High Loss/Low Benefit category.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_D_WCFL_2015/2_0_Tutorial_D_cap_27.png" class="img_2" style="width: 626px;height: 352px;" alt="Using the example grid cell from the previous step, and clicking on a High loss/Low benefit pixel with the Point Info tool, the overall burn probability dislays a value of .2250, which leads to a relative net value change value of -2.25.">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>On the Relative Net Value Change step, you can view your area of interest by flame length class (binned by the flame length classes you defined earlier).</p>
        <p>In this example, very high flame lengths (&gt;11 ft) are predicted for the western map area (including the Burdell Open Space Preserve, Pierre Joske Grove, and  oak woodlands), and the areas just west of Highway 101, both outlined in blue.<img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_D_WCFL_2015/2_0_Tutorial_D_cap_29.png" class="img_2" style="width: 668px;height: 291px;" alt="In this example, very high flame lengths (&amp;gt;11 ft) are predicted for the western map area (including the Burdell Open Space Preserve, Pierre Joske Grove, and  oak woodlands), and the areas just west of Highway 101, both outlined in blue."></img></p>
        <p>Taking a first look at the default relative net value change parameter, we can see that there are many pixels classified in the “Greatest Loss/Least Benefit” category (pixels representing areas at the highest risk of loss based on the values at risk and the overall burn probability).<img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_D_WCFL_2015/2_0_Tutorial_D_cap_30.png" class="img_2" style="width: 564px;height: 351px;" alt="The landscape shows many pixels classified in the “Greatest Loss/Least Benefit” category (pixels representing areas at the highest risk of loss based on the values at risk and the overall burn probability)."></img></p>
        <p>In this example, we cannot apply fuel treatments to all of the areas represented by the “Greatest Loss/Least Benefit” pixels, so we would like to refine the area of interest to find the areas that have the greatest potential loss.</p>
        <p>To classify these categories into different data ranges, choose <strong class="Strong">Next.</strong><![CDATA[  ]]></p>
        <p>In classifying relative net value change, you can adjust the weights of the five data subsets. Using this functionality, you can narrow your search of high fire hazard and risk areas to areas with the greatest potential loss.</p>
        <p>In this example, we will reduce the output range for the Greatest Loss/Least Benefit category from 20% to 10%. We will change the remaining output ranges as shown.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Tutorial_D_WCFL_2015/2_0_Tutorial_D_cap_31.png" class="img_2" style="width: 548px;height: 415px;" alt="The Classify Net Value Change page with Custom Relative Net Value Change Percentages as indicated in the text above.">

        <p>To view the user-binned relative net value change in the map summary, choose <strong class="Strong">Next</strong></p>
        <p>Note on the map summary page, your custom relative net value change distribution is the active layer. You can compare this custom relative net value change distribution layer to the default relative net value change distribution layer. In this example, you can see that the custom relative net value change reduced the amount of pixels in the Greatest Loss/Least Benefits category. </p>
        <p>Now we can focus our attention on the highest risk areas across our area of interest (outlined in blue).</p>
