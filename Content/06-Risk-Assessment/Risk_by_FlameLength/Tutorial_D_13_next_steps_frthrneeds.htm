        <h1>Next Steps:&#160; Assessing Further Needs</h1>
        <p>The information from this risk assessment can be used with other ecological and natural resource planning information to rapidly assess areas within the landscape that may warrant fuels treatment.</p>

        <p>After reviewing the aerial photography and the fire behavior fuel model layer, it is clear that the LANDFIRE data needs to be edited; return to the editing spatial landscape data step to edit your fuel models.&#160; Then rerun the module to see differences in the fire behavior and risk outputs.</p>
        <p>Navigate back to your risk assessment run in IFTDSS. </p>
